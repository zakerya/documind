      "text": "Expand your learning experience with the Tools for Enriching Calculus CD - ROM The Tools for Enriching Calculus CD- ROM is the ideal complement to Essential Calculus. This innovative learning tool uses a discovery and exploratory approach to help you explore calculus in new ways. Visuals and Modules on the CD - ROM provide geometric visualizations and graphi- cal applications to enrich your understanding of major concepts. Exercises and examples, built from the content in the applets, take a discovery approach, allowing you to explore open-ended questions about the way certain mathematical objects behave. The CD - ROM ’s simulation modules include audio explanations of the concept, along with exercises, examples, and instructions. Tools for Enriching Calculus also contains Homework Hints for representative exercises from the text (indicated in blue in the text). Hours of interactive video instruction! Interactive Video Skillbuilder CD - ROM The Interactive Video Skillbuilder CD - ROM contains more than eight hours of video instruction.The problems worked during each video lesson are shown first so that you can try working them before watching the solution.To help you evaluate your progress, each section of the text contains a ten-question web quiz (the results of which can be e-mailed to your instructor), and each chapter contains a chapter test, with answers to every problem. Icons in the text direct you to examples that are worked out on the CD - ROM . If you would like to"

      "text": "This book is a response to those instructors who feel that calculus textbooks are too big. In writing the book I asked myself: What is essential for a three-semester calcu- lus course for scientists and engineers? The book is about two-thirds the size of my other calculus books ( Calculus, Fifth Edition and Calculus, Early Transcendentals, Fifth Edition) and yet it contains almost all of the same topics. I have achieved relative brevity mainly by condensing the expo- sition and by putting some of the features on the website www.stewartcalculus.com . Here, in more detail are some of the ways I have reduced the bulk: ■ I have organized topics in an efficient way and rewritten some sections with briefer exposition. ■ The design saves space. In particular, chapter opening spreads and photo- graphs have been eliminated. ■ The number of examples is slightly reduced. Additional examples are provided online. ■ The number of exercises is somewhat reduced, though most instructors will find that there are plenty. In addition, instructors have access to the archived problems on the website. ■ Although I think projects can be a very valuable experience for students, I have removed them from the book and placed them on the website. ■ A discussion of the principles of problem solving and a collection of chal- lenging problems for each chapter have been moved to the web.

Despite the reduced size of the book, there is still a modern flavor: Conceptual understanding and technology are not neglected, though they are not as prominent as in my other books. CONTENT This book treats the exponential, logarithmic, and inverse trigonometric functions early, in Chapter 3. Those who wish to cover such functions later, with the logarithm defined as an integral, should look at my book titled simply Essential Calculus. CHAPTER 1 ■ FUNCTIONS AND LIMITS After a brief review of the basic functions, lim- its and continuity are introduced, including limits of trigonometric functions, limits involving infinity, and precise definitions. CHAPTER 2 ■ DERIVATIVES The material on derivatives is covered in two sections in order to give students time to get used to the idea of a derivative as a function. The PREFACE vii"

CHAPTER 3 ■ INVERSE FUNCTIONS: EXPONENTIAL, LOGARITHMIC, AND INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS Exponential functions are defined first and the number e is defined as a limit. Loga- rithms are then defined as inverse functions. Applications to exponential growth and decay follow. Inverse trigonometric functions and hyperbolic functions are also covered here. L’Hospital’s Rule is included in this chapter because limits of transcen- dental functions so often require it. CHAPTER 4 ■ APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION The basic facts concerning extreme values and shapes of curves are deduced from the Mean Value Theorem. The section on curve sketching includes a brief treatment of graphing with technology. The sec- tion on optimization problems contains a brief discussion of applications to business and economics. CHAPTER 5 ■ INTEGRALS The area problem and the distance problem serve to moti- vate the definite integral, with sigma notation introduced as needed. (Full coverage of sigma notation is provided in Appendix C.) A quite general definition of the definite integral (with unequal subintervals) is given initially before regular partitions are employed. Emphasis is placed on explaining the meanings of integrals in various con- texts and on estimating their values from graphs and tables. CHAPTER 6"

CHAPTER 6 ■ TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION All the standard methods are covered, as well as computer algebra systems, numerical methods, and improper integrals. CHAPTER 7 ■ APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION General methods are emphasized. The goal is for students to be able to divide a quantity into small pieces, estimate with Rie- mann sums, and recognize the limit as an integral. The chapter concludes with an introduction to differential equations, including separable equations and direction fields. CHAPTER 8 ■ SERIES The convergence tests have intuitive justifications as well as for- mal proofs. The emphasis is on Taylor series and polynomials and their applications to physics. Error estimates include those based on Taylor’s Formula (with Lagrange’s form of the remainder term) and those from graphing devices.

      "text": "xii TO THE STUDENT Reading a calculus textbook is different from reading a news- paper or a novel, or even a physics book. Don’t be discour- aged if you have to read a passage more than once in order to understand it. You should have pencil and paper and calcula- tor at hand to sketch a diagram or make a calculation. Some students start by trying their homework problems and read the text only if they get stuck on an exercise. I sug- gest that a far better plan is to read and understand a section of the text before attempting the exercises. In particular, you should look at the definitions to see the exact meanings of the terms. And before you read each example, I suggest that you cover up the solution and try solving the problem yourself. You’ll get a lot more from looking at the solution if you do so. Part of the aim of this course is to train you to think logi- cally. Learn to write the solutions of the exercises in a con- nected, step-by-step fashion with explanatory sentences—not just a string of disconnected equations or formulas. The answers to the odd-numbered exercises appear at the back of the book, in Appendix E. Some exercises ask for a verbal explanation or interpretation or description. In such cases there is no single correct way of expressing the answer, so don’t worry that you haven’t found the definitive answer.

Calculus is less static and more dynamic. It is concerned with change and motion; it deals with quantities that approach other quantities. So in this first chapter we begin our study of calculus by investi- gating how the values of functions change and approach limits. 1 1 Population Year (millions) 1900 1650 1910 1750 1920 1860 1930 2070 1940 2300 1950 2560 1960 3040 1970 3710 1980 4450 1990 5280 2000 6080"

The set is called the domain of the function. The number is the value of at and is read “ of .” The range of is the set of all possible values of as varies throughout the domain. A symbol that represents an arbitrary number in the domain of a function is called an independent variable . A symbol that represents a number in the range of is called a dependent variable . In Example A, for instance, is the independent variable and is the dependent variable. It’s helpful to think of a function as a machine (see Figure 2). If is in the domain of the function then when enters the machine, it’s accepted as an input and the machine produces an output according to the rule of the function. Thus we can think of the domain as the set of all possible inputs and the range as the set of all pos- sible outputs. Another way to picture a function is by an arrow diagram as in Figure 3. Each arrow connects an element of to an element of . The arrow indicates that is associated with is associated with , and so on. The most common method for visualizing a function is its graph.

But certain functions are described more naturally by one method than by another. With this in mind, let’s reexamine the four situations that we considered at the beginning of this section. A. The most useful representation of the area of a circle as a function of its radius is probably the algebraic formula , though it is possible to compile a table of values or to sketch a graph (half a parabola). Because a circle has to have a positive radius, the domain is , and the range is also . B. We are given a description of the function in words: is the human population of the world at time t . The table of values of world population provides a con- venient representation of this function. If we plot these values, we get the graph (called a scatter plot ) in Figure 7.

Of course, it’s impossible to devise an explicit formula that gives the exact human population at any time t . But it is possible to find an expression for a function that approximates . In fact, we could use a graphing calculator with exponential regression capabilities to obtain the approximation and Figure 8 shows that it is a reasonably good “fit.” The function is called a mathematical model for population growth. In other words, it is a function with an explicit formula that approximates the behavior of our given function. We will see, however, that the ideas of calculus can be applied to a table of values; an explicit formula is not necessary.

Then we may be able to construct a table of values of the function, perhaps from instrument readings in a scientific experiment. Even though we don’t have com- plete knowledge of the values of the function, we will see throughout the book that it is still possible to perform the operations of calculus on such a function. C. Again the function is described in words: is the cost of mailing a first-class letter with weight . The rule that the US Postal Service used as of 2006 is as fol- lows: The cost is 39 cents for up to one ounce, plus 24 cents for each successive ounce up to 13 ounces. The table of values shown in the margin is the most con- venient representation for this function, though it is possible to sketch a graph (see Example 6). D. The graph shown in Figure 1 is the most natural representation of the vertical accel- eration function . It’s true that a table of values could be compiled, and it is even possible to devise an approximate formula. But everything a geologist needs to know—amplitudes and patterns—can be seen easily from the graph.

SOLUTION The initial temperature of the running water is close to room tempera- ture because the water has been sitting in the pipes. When the water from the hot- water tank starts flowing from the faucet, increases quickly. In the next phase, is constant at the temperature of the heated water in the tank. When the tank is drained, decreases to the temperature of the water supply. This enables us to make the rough sketch of as a function of in Figure 9. ■ EXAMPLE 3 Find the domain of each function.

But if a line intersects the curve twice, at and , then the curve can’t represent a function because a function can’t assign two different values to . PIECEWISE DEFINED FUNCTIONS The functions in the following three examples are defined by different formulas in dif- ferent parts of their domains. EXAMPLE 4 A function is defined by Evaluate , , and and sketch the graph. SOLUTION Remember that a function is a rule. For this particular function the rule is the following: First look at the value of the input . If it happens that , then the value of is . On the other hand, if , then the value of is . How do we draw the graph of ? We observe that if , then , so the part of the graph of that lies to the left of the vertical line must coin- cide with the line , which has slope and -intercept 1. If , then , so the part of the graph of that lies to the right of the line must coincide with the graph of , which is a parabola. This enables us to sketch the graph in Figure l1.

SOLUTION From the preceding discussion we know that Using the same method as in Example 4, we see that the graph of coincides with the line to the right of the -axis and coincides with the line to the left of the -axis (see Figure 12). ■ EXAMPLE 6 In Example C at the beginning of this section we considered the cost of mailing a first-class letter with weight .

You can see why functions similar to this one are called step functions —they jump from one value to the next. ■ SYMMETRY If a function satisfies for every number in its domain, then is called an even function .

For example, the function is odd because The graph of an odd function is symmetric about the origin (see Figure 15 on page 6). If we already have the graph of for , we can obtain the entire graph by rotat- ing this portion through about the origin. EXAMPLE 7 Determine whether each of the following functions is even, odd, or neither even nor odd. (a) (b) (c) SOLUTION (a) Therefore, is an odd function. (b) So is even.

      "text": "MATHEMATICAL MODELING A mathematical model is a mathematical description (often by means of a function or an equation) of a real-world phenomenon such as the size of a population, the demand for a product, the speed of a falling object, the concentration of a product in a chemical reaction, the life expectancy of a person at birth, or the cost of emission reductions. The purpose of the model is to understand the phenomenon and perhaps to make predictions about future behavior. Figure 1 illustrates the process of mathematical modeling. Given a real-world prob- lem, our first task is to formulate a mathematical model by identifying and naming the independent and dependent variables and making assumptions that simplify the phe- nomenon enough to make it mathematically tractable. We use our knowledge of the physical situation and our mathematical skills to obtain equations that relate the vari- ables. In situations where there is no physical law to guide us, we may need to collect data (either from a library or the Internet or by conducting our own experiments) and examine the data in the form of a table in order to discern patterns. From this numeri- cal representation of a function we may wish to obtain a graphical representation by plotting the data. The graph might even suggest a suitable algebraic formula in some cases. The second stage is to apply the mathematics that we know (such as the calculus that will be developed throughout this book) to the mathematical model that w"

The second stage is to apply the mathematics that we know (such as the calculus that will be developed throughout this book) to the mathematical model that we have formulated in order to derive mathematical conclusions. Then, in the third stage, we take those mathematical conclusions and interpret them as information about the origi- nal real-world phenomenon by way of offering explanations or making predictions. The final step is to test our predictions by checking against new real data. If the pre- dictions don’t compare well with reality, we need to refine our model or to formulate a new model and start the cycle again. A mathematical model is never a completely accurate representation of a physical situation—it is an idealization. A good model simplifies reality enough to permit mathematical calculations but is accurate enough to provide valuable conclusions. It is important to realize the limitations of the model. In the end, Mother Nature has the final say. There are many different types of functions that can be used to model relationships observed in the real world. In what follows, we discuss the behavior and graphs of these functions and give examples of situations appropriately modeled by such functions. ■ LINEAR MODELS When we say that y is a linear function of x , we mean that the graph of the function is a line, so we can"

Notice that whenever x increases by 0.1, the value of increases by 0.3. So increases three times as fast as x . Thus the slope of the graph , namely 3, can be interpreted as the rate of change of y with respect to x . EXAMPLE 1 (a) As dry air moves upward, it expands and cools.

If c is a positive number, then the graph of is just the graph of shifted upward a distance of c units (because each y -coordinate is increased by the same number c ). Likewise, if , where , then the value of at x is the same as the value of at ( c units to the left of x ). Therefore, the graph of is just the graph of shifted units to the right. VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL SHIFTS Suppose . To obtain the graph of Now let’s consider the stretching and reflecting transformations. If , then the graph of is the graph of stretched by a factor of c in the vertical direction (because each y -coordinate is multiplied by the same number c ). The graph of is the graph of reflected about the -axis because the point is replaced by the point . The following chart also incorporates the results of other stretching, compressing, and reflecting transformations. VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL STRETCHING AND REFLECTING Suppose . To obtain the graph of Figure 16 illustrates these stretching transformations when applied to the cosine function with .

We begin by showing how the idea of a limit arises when we try to find the velocity of a falling ball. EXAMPLE 1 Suppose that a ball is dropped from the upper observation deck of the CN Tower in Toronto, 450 m above the ground. Find the velocity of the ball after 5 seconds. SOLUTION Through experiments carried out four centuries ago, Galileo discovered that the distance fallen by any freely falling body is proportional to the square of the time it has been falling.

      "text": "UTION Through experiments carried out four centuries ago, Galileo discovered that the distance fallen by any freely falling body is proportional to the square of the time it has been falling. (This model for free fall neglects air resistance.) If the dis- tance fallen after seconds is denoted by and measured in meters, then Galileo’s law is expressed by the equation The difficulty in finding the velocity after 5 s is that we are dealing with a single instant of time , so no time interval is involved. However, we can approxi- mate the desired quantity by computing the average velocity over the brief time interval of a tenth of a second from to : The table shows the results of similar calculations of the average velocity over suc- cessively smaller time periods. It appears that as we shorten the time period, the average velocity is becoming closer to 49 m \b s. The instantaneous velocity when is defined to be the limiting value of these average velocities over shorter and shorter time periods that start at .

The following table gives values of for values of close to 2, but not equal to 2. From the table and the graph of (a parabola) shown in Figure 1 we see that when is close to 2 (on either side of 2), is close to 4. In fact, it appears that we can make the values of as close as we like to 4 by taking sufficiently close to 2. We express this by saying “the limit of the function as approaches 2 is equal to 4.” The notation for this is In general, we use the following notation. DEFINITION We write and say “the limit of , as approaches , equals ” if we can make the values of arbitrarily close to (as close to L as we like) by taking x to be sufficiently close to (on either side of ) but not equal to . Roughly speaking, this says that the values of tend to get closer and closer to the number as gets closer and closer to the number (from either side of ) but . An alternative notation for is as which is usually read “ approaches as approaches .” Notice the phrase “but ” in the definition of limit. This means that in finding the limit of as approaches , we never consider . In fact, need not even be defined when . The only thing that matter"

Constant Multiple Law 3. The limit of a constant times a function is the constant times the limit of the function. Product Law 4. The limit of a product is the product of the limits. Quotient Law 5. The limit of a quotient is the quotient of the limits (provided that the limit of the denominator is not 0). It is easy to believe that these properties are true. For instance, if is close to and is close to , it is reasonable to conclude that is close to . This gives us an intuitive basis for believing that Law 1 is true. All of these laws can be proved using the precise definition of a limit. (See Appendix B.) If we use the Product Law repeatedly with , we obtain the following law.

When he entered Cambridge University in 1661 Newton didn’t know much mathematics, but he learned quickly by reading Euclid and Descartes and by attending the lectures of Isaac Barrow. Cam- bridge was closed because of the plague in 1665 and 1666, and Newton returned home to reflect on what he had learned. Those two years were amazingly productive for at that time he made four of his major discoveries: (1) his representation of functions as sums of infinite series, including the binomial theorem; (2) his work on differential and integral calcu- lus; (3) his laws of motion and law of universal gravitation; and (4) his prism experiments on the nature of light and color.

Because of a fear of controversy and criticism, he was reluctant to publish his discoveries and it wasn’t until 1687, at the urging of the astronomer Halley, that Newton published Principia Mathematica . In this work, the greatest scientific treatise ever written, Newton set forth his version of calculus and used it to investigate mechanics, fluid dynamics, and wave motion, and to explain the motion of planets and comets. The beginnings of calculus are found in the calculations of areas and volumes by ancient Greek scholars such as Eudoxus and Archimedes. Although aspects of the idea of a limit are implicit in their “method of exhaus- tion,” Eudoxus and Archimedes never explicitly formulated the concept of a limit. Likewise, mathematicians such as Cavalieri, Fermat, and Barrow, the immediate precursors of Newton in the development of calculus, did not actually use limits. It was Isaac Newton who was the first to talk explicitly about limits. He explained that the main idea behind limits is that quanti- ties “approach nearer than by any given differ- ence.” Newton stated that the limit was the basic concept in calculus, but it was left to later mathematicians like Cauchy to clarify his ideas about limits. ¨ 1 x 0 y (1, 0"

The addition formulas for cosine and sine can then be used to deduce that these functions satisfy the Direct Substitution Property everywhere (see Exercises 51 and 52).

For example, Functions with the Direct Substitution Property are called continuous at a and will be studied in Section 1.5.

      "text": "42 ■ CHAPTER 1 FUNCTIONS AND LIMITS In Example 4 in Section 1.3 we made the guess, on the basis of numerical and graphical evidence, that We can prove Equation 5 with help from the Squeeze Theorem. Assume first that lies between 0 and . Figure 8(a) shows a sector of a circle with center O , central angle , and radius 1. BC is drawn perpendicular to OA . By the definition of radian measure, we have arc . Also, . From the diagram we see that Therefore so Let the tangent lines at and intersect at . You can see from Figure 8(b) that the circumference of a circle is smaller than the length of a circumscribed polygon, and so arc . Thus (In Appendix B the inequality is proved directly from the definition of the length of an arc without resorting to geometric intuition as we did here.) Therefore, we have and so We know that and , so by the Squeeze Theorem, we have But the function is an even function, so its right and left limits must be equal. Hence, we have so we have proved Equation 5.

The definition says that is continuous at if approaches as x approaches a . Thus a continuous function has the property that a small change in x produces only a small change in . In fact, the change in can be kept as small as we please by keeping the change in sufficiently small. If is defined near (in other words, is defined on an open interval containing , except perhaps at ), we say that is discontinuous at a (or has a discontinuity at ) if is not continuous at . Physical phenomena are usually continuous. For instance, the displacement or velocity of a vehicle varies continuously with time, as does a person’s height. But dis- continuities do occur in such situations as electric currents. [See Example 6 in Sec- tion 1.3, where the Heaviside function is discontinuous at because does not exist.] Geometrically, you can think of a function that is continuous at every number in an interval as a function whose graph has no break in it.

THE INTERMEDIATE VALUE THEOREM Suppose that is continuous on the closed interval and let be any number between and , where . Then there exists a number in such that . The Intermediate Value Theorem states that a continuous function takes on every intermediate value between the function values and . It is illustrated by Fig- ure 6. Note that the value can be taken on once [as in part (a)] or more than once [as in part (b)]. If we think of a continuous function as a function whose graph has no hole or break, then it is easy to believe that the Intermediate Value Theorem is true.

The Intermediate Value Theorem is not true in general for discontinuous functions (see Exercise 34).

We are looking for a solution of the given equation, that is, a number between 1 and 2 such that . Therefore, we take , , and in Theorem 9. We have and Thus ; that is, is a number between and .

      "text": "DERIVATIVES AND RATES OF CHANGE The problem of finding the tangent line to a curve and the problem of finding the velocity of an object involve finding the same type of limit, which we call a derivative. THE TANGENT PROBLEM The word tangent is derived from the Latin word tangens , which means “touching.” Thus a tangent to a curve is a line that touches the curve. In other words, a tangent line should have the same direction as the curve at the point of contact. How can this idea be made precise? For a circle we could simply follow Euclid and say that a tangent is a line that inter- sects the circle once and only once as in Figure 1(a). For more complicated curves this definition is inadequate. Figure l(b) shows two lines and passing through a point on a curve . The line intersects only once, but it certainly does not look like what we think of as a tangent. The line , on the other hand, looks like a tangent but it intersects twice. To be specific, let’s look at the problem of trying to find a tangent line to the parabola in the following example. EXAMPLE 1 Find an equation of the tangent line to the parabola at the point . SOLUTION We will be able to find an equation of the tangent line as soon as we know its slope . The difficulty is that we know only one point, , on , whereas we need two points to compute the slope.

By analogy with velocity, we consider the average rate of change over smaller and smaller intervals by letting approach and therefore letting approach . The limit of these average rates of change is called the ( instantaneous ) rate of change of y with respect to x at \u0002 , which is interpreted as the slope of the tangent to the curve at : We recognize this limit as being the derivative . We know that one interpretation of the derivative is as the slope of the tan- gent line to the curve when . We now have a second interpretation: The derivative is the instantaneous rate of change of with respect to when . The connection with the first interpretation is that if we sketch the curve , then the instantaneous rate of change is the slope of the tangent to this curve at the point where . This means that when the derivative is large (and therefore the curve is steep, as at the point in Figure 12), the -values change rapidly. When the derivative is small, the curve is relatively flat and the -values change slowly.

[Here we are making the reasonable assumption that the debt didn’t fluctuate wildly between 1980 and 2000.] We estimate that the rate of increase of the national debt of the United States in 1990 was the average of these two numbers, namely Another method would be to plot the debt function and estimate the slope of the tangent line when . ■ The rate of change of the debt with respect to time in Example 6 is just one example of a rate of change. Here are a few of the many others: The velocity of a particle is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time.

After earning his doctorate in law at age 20, Leibniz entered the diplomatic service and spent most of his life traveling to the capitals of Europe on political missions. In particular, he worked to avert a French mili- tary threat against Germany and attempted to reconcile the Catholic and Protestant churches. His serious study of mathematics did not begin until 1672 while he was on a diplomatic mission in Paris. There he built a calculating machine and met scientists, like Huygens, who directed his attention to the latest develop- ments in mathematics and science. Leibniz sought to develop a symbolic logic and system of notation that would simplify logical reason- ing. In particular, the version of calculus that he published in 1684 established the notation and the rules for finding derivatives that we use today.

In particular, the version of calculus that he published in 1684 established the notation and the rules for finding derivatives that we use today. Unfortunately, a dreadful priority dispute arose in the 1690s between the followers of Newton and those of Leibniz as to who had invented calculus first. Leibniz was even accused of plagiarism by members of the Royal Society in England. The truth is that each man invented calculus independently. Newton arrived at his version of calculus first but, because of his fear of controversy, did not publish it immediately. So Leibniz’s 1684 account of calculus was the first to be published."

In general, if the graph of a function has a “corner” or “kink” in it, then the graph of has no tangent at this point and is not differentiable there. [In trying to compute , we find that the left and right limits are different.] Theorem 4 gives another way for a function not to have a derivative. It says that if is not continuous at , then is not differentiable at . So at any discontinuity (for instance, a jump discontinuity) fails to be differentiable. A third possibility is that the curve has a vertical tangent line when ; that is, is continuous at and This means that the tangent lines become steeper and steeper as . Figure 6 shows one way that this can happen; Figure 7(c) shows another. Figure 7 illustrates the three possibilities that we have discussed. A graphing calculator or computer provides another way of looking at differentia- bility. If is differentiable at , then when we zoom in toward the point the graph straightens out and appears more and more like a line. (See Figure 8. We saw a specific example of this in Figure 4 in Section 2.1.)

We can see, however, that this guess is wrong by looking at a particular example. Let and . Then the Power Rule gives and . But , so . Thus .

SOLUTION (a) If , then the outer function is the sine function and the inner function is the squaring function, so the Chain Rule gives (b) Note that . Here the outer function is the squaring function and the inner function is the sine function. So The answer can be left as or written as (by a trigonometric identity known as the double-angle formula). ■ In Example 2(a) we combined the Chain Rule with the rule for differentiating the sine function. In general, if , where is a differentiable function of , then, by the Chain Rule, Thus In a similar fashion, all of the formulas for differentiating trigonometric functions can be combined with the Chain Rule. Let’s make explicit the special case of the Chain Rule where the outer function is a power function. If , then we can write where .

But it is much easier to measure directly the rate of increase of the volume than the rate of increase of the radius. In a related rates problem the idea is to compute the rate of change of one quantity in terms of the rate of change of another quantity (which may be more easily mea- sured). The procedure is to find an equation that relates the two quantities and then use the Chain Rule to differentiate both sides with respect to time.

How fast is the radius of the balloon increasing when the diameter is 50 cm? SOLUTION We start by identifying two things: the given information: the rate of increase of the volume of air is and the unknown : the rate of increase of the radius when the diameter is 50 cm In order to express these quantities mathematically, we introduce some suggestive notation : Let V be the volume of the balloon and let r be its radius. The key thing to remember is that rates of change are derivatives. In this problem, the volume and the radius are both functions of the time . The rate of increase of the volume with respect to time is the derivative , and the rate of increase of the radius is . We can therefore restate the given and the unknown as follows: Given: Unknown: dr dt when r \u0002 25 cm dV dt \u0002 100 cm 3 \b s dr \b dt dV \b dt t 100 cm 3 \b s 100 cm 3 \b s V 2.7"

Notice from this table, and also from Figure 2, that the tangent line approximation gives good estimates when x is close to 1 but the accu- racy of the approximation deteriorates when x is farther away from 1.

Similarly, from Figure 4 we see that the approximation is accurate to within 0.1 when . ■ APPLICATIONS TO PHYSICS Linear approximations are often used in physics. In analyzing the consequences of an equation, a physicist sometimes needs to simplify a function by replacing it with its linear approximation. For instance, in deriving a formula for the period of a pendu- lum, physics textbooks obtain the expression for tangential accelera- tion and then replace by with the remark that is very close to if is not too large. [See, for example, Physics: Calculus, 2d ed., by Eugene Hecht (Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole, 2000), p. 431.] You can verify that the linearization of the function at a \u0002 0 is and so the linear approximation at 0 is (see Exercise 26). So, in effect, the derivation of the formula for the period of a pen- dulum uses the tangent line approximation for the sine function. Another example occurs in the theory of optics, where light rays that arrive at shallow angles relative to the optical axis are called paraxial rays. In paraxial (or G"

In paraxial (or Gaus- sian) optics, both and are replaced by their linearizations. In other words, the linear approximations and are used because is close to 0. The results of calculations made with these approxi- mations became the basic theoretical tool used to design lenses. [See Optics, 4th ed., by Eugene Hecht (San Francisco: Addison Wesley, 2002), p. 154.] In Section 8.8 we will present several other applications of the idea of linear approxi- mations to physics. DIFFERENTIALS The ideas behind linear approximations are sometimes formulated in the terminology and notation of differentials. If , where is a differentiable function, then the differential is an independent variable; that is, can be given the value of any real number. The differential is then defined in terms of by the equation So is a dependent variable; it depends on the values of and .

      "text": "EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS The function is called an exponential function because the variable, x , is the exponent. It should not be confused with the power function , in which the variable is the base. In general, an exponential function is a function of the form where is a positive constant. Let’s recall what this means. If , a positive integer, then n factors If , and if , where is a positive integer, then If is a rational number, , where and are integers and , then But what is the meaning of if x is an irrational number? For instance, what is meant by or ? To help us answer this question we first look at the graph of the function , where x is rational. A representation of this graph is shown in Figure 1. We want to enlarge the domain of to include both rational and irrational numbers. There are holes in the graph in Figure 1 corresponding to irrational values of x . We want to fill in the holes by defining , where , so that is an increasing continuous function.

In particular, two of the most important functions that occur in mathematics and its applications are the exponential function and its inverse function, the logarithmic func- tion . Here we investigate their properties, compute their derivatives, and use them to describe exponential growth and decay in biology, physics, chemistry, and other sciences.We also study the inverses of the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. Finally we look at a method (l’Hospital’s Rule) for computing limits of such functions. t \u0002 x \u0003 \u0002 log a x f \u0002 x \u0003 \u0002 a x 3 142 FIGURE 1 Representation of y=2® , x rational x 0 y 1 1"

As a check on our graph, notice that the expression for is . So the graph of is the right half of the parabola and this seems reasonable from Figure 10. ■ THE CALCULUS OF INVERSE FUNCTIONS Now let’s look at inverse functions from the point of view of calculus. Suppose that is both one-to-one and continuous. We think of a continuous function as one whose graph has no break in it. (It consists of just one piece.) Since the graph of is obtained from the graph of by reflecting about the line , the graph of has no break in it either (see Figure 9). Thus we might expect that is also a continu- ous function. This geometrical argument does not prove the following theorem but at least it makes the theorem plausible. A proof can be found in Appendix B. THEOREM If is a one-to-one continuous function defined on an interval, then its inverse function is also continuous. Now suppose that is a one-to-one differentiable function. Geometrically we can think of a differentiable function as one whose graph has no corner or kink in it. We get the graph of by reflecting the graph of about the line , so the graph of has no corner or kink in it either.

We have a slight difficulty in this task: Because the trigonometric functions are not one-to-one, they do not have inverse functions. The difficulty is overcome by restricting the domains of these functions so that they become one-to-one. You can see from Figure 1 that the sine function is not one-to-one (use the Horizontal Line Test). But the function (see Figure 2), is one-to-one. The inverse function of this restricted sine function exists and is denoted by or . It is called the inverse sine function or the arcsine function .

Applications of hyperbolic functions to science and engineering occur whenever an entity such as light, velocity, electricity, or radioactivity is gradually absorbed or extinguished, for the decay can be represented by hyperbolic functions. The most famous application is the use of hyperbolic cosine to describe the shape of a hanging wire.

In fact, although the limit in (1) exists, its value is not obvious because both numerator and denominator approach and is not defined. In general, if we have a limit of the form where both and as , then this limit may or may not exist and is called an indeterminate form of type . We met some limits of this type in Chap- ter 1.

Although the numerator as , notice that the denominator does not approach , so l’Hospital’s Rule can’t be applied here. The required limit is, in fact, easy to find because the function is continuous at and the denominator is nonzero there: ■ Example 5 shows what can go wrong if you use l’Hospital’s Rule without think- ing. Other limits can be found using l’Hospital’s Rule but are more easily found by other methods. (See Examples 2 and 4 in Section 1.4, Example 5 in Section 1.6, and the discussion at the beginning of this section.) So when evaluating any limit, you should consider other methods before using l’Hospital’s Rule. INDETERMINATE PRODUCTS If and (or ), then it isn’t clear what the value of , if any, will be.

      "text": "MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM VALUES Some of the most important applications of differential calculus are optimization problems, in which we are required to find the optimal (best) way of doing something. Here are examples of such problems that we will solve in this chapter: ■ What is the shape of a can that minimizes manufacturing costs? ■ What is the maximum acceleration of a space shuttle? (This is an important question to the astronauts who have to withstand the effects of acceleration.) ■ What is the radius of a contracted windpipe that expels air most rapidly during a cough? ■ How far should you stand from a painting in an art gallery to get the best view of the painting? These problems can be reduced to finding the maximum or minimum values of a func- tion. Let’s first explain exactly what we mean by maximum and minimum values. DEFINITION A function has an absolute maximum (or global maxi- mum ) at if for all in , where is the domain of . The num- ber is called the maximum value of on . Similarly, has an absolute minimum at if for all in and the number is called the minimum value of on . The maximum and minimum values of are called the extreme values of . Figure 1 shows the graph of a function with absolute maximum at and absolute minimum at . Note that is the highest point on the graph and is the lowest point.

Likewise, is called a local minimum value of because for near [in the interval , for instance]. The function also has a local minimum at .

Here we learn how derivatives affect the shape of a graph of a function and, in par- ticular, how they help us locate maximum and minimum values of functions. Many practical prob- lems require us to minimize a cost or maximize an area or somehow find the best possible outcome of a situation. In particular, we will be able to investigate the optimal shape of a can and to explain the shape of cells in beehives. 4 198 f(a) f(d) b x y 0 d e a c FIGURE 1 Minimum value f(a) , maximum value f(d)"

The function f whose graph is shown in Figure 6 is defined on the closed interval [0, 2] but has no maximum value. [Notice that the range of f is [0, 3). The function takes on values arbitrarily close to 3, but never actually attains the value 3.] This does not contradict the Extreme Value Theorem because f is not continuous.

Using this model, estimate the absolute maximum and minimum values of the acceleration of the shuttle between liftoff and the jettisoning of the boosters. 59. When a foreign object lodged in the trachea (windpipe) forces a person to cough, the diaphragm thrusts upward causing an increase in pressure in the lungs. This is accom- panied by a contraction of the trachea, making a narrower channel for the expelled air to flow through. For a given amount of air to escape in a fixed time, it must move faster through the narrower channel than the wider one. The greater the velocity of the airstream, the greater the force on the foreign object.

But to arrive at the Mean Value Theorem we first need the following result. ROLLE’S THEOREM Let be a function that satisfies the following three hypotheses: 1. is continuous on the closed interval . 2. is differentiable on the open interval . 3. Then there is a number in such that . Before giving the proof let’s take a look at the graphs of some typical functions that satisfy the three hypotheses. Figure 1 shows the graphs of four such functions.

Later, however, he became a vocal critic of the methods of his day and attacked calculus as being a “collec- tion of ingenious fallacies.”"

He was a child prodigy and became a professor in Turin at the tender age of 19. Lagrange made great contributions to number theory, theory of functions, theory of equations, and analytical and celestial mechanics. In particular, he applied calculus to the analysis of the stability of the solar system. At the invitation of Frederick the Great, he succeeded Euler at the Berlin Acad- emy and, when Frederick died, Lagrange accepted King Louis XVI’s invitation to Paris, where he was given apartments in the Louvre. Despite all the trappings of luxury and fame, he was a kind and quiet man, living only for science. FIGURE 6"

      "text": "and the velocity at is . Thus the Mean Value Theorem (in the form of Equation 1) tells us that at some time between and the instantaneous velocity is equal to that average velocity. For instance, if a car traveled 180 km in 2 hours, then the speedometer must have read 90 km \b h at least once. In general, the Mean Value Theorem can be interpreted as saying that there is a number at which the instantaneous rate of change is equal to the average rate of change over an interval. ■ The main significance of the Mean Value Theorem is that it enables us to obtain information about a function from information about its derivative. The next example provides an instance of this principle. EXAMPLE 5 Suppose that and for all values of . How large can possibly be?

Let’s see how the second derivative helps determine the intervals of concavity. Looking at Figure 6(a), you can see that, going from left to right, the slope of the tan- gent increases. This means that the derivative is an increasing function and there- fore its derivative is positive. Likewise, in Figure 6(b) the slope of the tangent decreases from left to right, so decreases and therefore is negative. This reason- ing can be reversed and suggests that the following theorem is true. A proof is given in Appendix B with the help of the Mean Value Theorem.

Using the local minimum, the intervals of concavity, and the inflection points, we sketch the curve in Figure 10. ■ \u0002 2, \u0002 16 \u0003 \u0002 0, 0 \u0003 2 x \u0002 0 f \u0014 \u0002 x \u0003 \u0002 0 f f \u0012 \u0002 x \u0003 f 0 \u0006 x \u0006 3 x \u0006 0 f \u0012 \u0002 x \u0003 \u0006 0 f \u0014 \u0002 0 \u0003 \u0002 0 f \u0002 3 \u0003 \u0002 \u0002 27 f \u0014 \u0002 3 \u0003 \u0007 0 f \u0012 \u0002 3 \u0003 \u0002 0 f \u0014 \u0002 3 \u0003 \u0002 36 \u0007 0 f \u0014 \u0002 0 \u0003 \u0002 0 f \u0014 x \u0002 3 x \u0002 0 f \u0012 \u0002 x \u0003 \u0002 0 f \u0014 \u0002 x \u0003 \u0002 12 x 2 \u0002 24 x \u0002 12 x \u0002 x \u0002 2 \u0003 f \u0012 \u0002 x \u0003 \u0002 4 x 3 \u0002 12 x 2 \u0002 4 x 2 \u0002 x \u0002 3 \u0003 f \u0002 x \u0003 \u0002 x 4 \u0002 4 x 3 y \u0002 x 4 \u0002 4 x 3 V c f f c f f \u0014 \u0002 x \u0003 \u0007 0 c f f \u0014 \u0002 c \u0003 \u0006 0 f \u0012 \u0002 c \u0003 \u0002 0 c f f \u0014 \u0002 c \u0003 \u0007 0 f \u0012 \u0002 c \u0003 \u0002 0 c f \u0014 x \u0007 2 x \u0006 \u0002 2 x \u0002 \u0002 2 x \u0002 1 f y \u0002 \u0002 2 216 ■ CHAPTER 4 APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION FIGURE 8 x y=_2 0 1 2 -2 y fª(c)=0 f(c) ƒ c P x x y 0 FIGURE 9 f·(c)>0 , f is concave upward f FIGURE 10 x y 2 3 (2, _16) (3, _27) y=x$-4˛ inflection points (0, 0) Interval Concavity ( \u0002 , 0) \u0003 upward (0, 2) \u0002 downward (2, ) \u0003 upward f \u0014 \u0002 x \u0003"

In other words, at such a point there might be a maximum, there might be a minimum, or there might be neither (as in Example 5). This test also fails when does not exist. In such cases the First Derivative Test must be used. In fact, even when both tests apply, the First Derivative Test is often the easier one to use. EXAMPLE 6 Sketch the graph of the function . SOLUTION You can use the differentiation rules to check that the first two deriva- tives are Since when and does not exist when or , the critical numbers are , and . To find the local extreme values we use the First Derivative Test. Since changes from negative to positive at 0, is a local minimum. Since changes from positive to negative at 4, is a local maximum. The sign of does not change at 6, so there is no minimum or maximum there. (The Second Derivative Test could be used at 4 but not at 0 or 6 since does not exist at either of these numbers.)

      "text": "CURVE SKETCHING So far we have been concerned with some particular aspects of curve sketching: domain, range, symmetry, limits, continuity, and asymptotes in Chapter 1; derivatives and tangents in Chapters 2 and 3; l’Hospital’s Rule in Chapter 3; and extreme values, intervals of increase and decrease, concavity, and points of inflection in this chapter. It’s now time to put all of this information together to sketch graphs that reveal the important features of functions. You may ask: Why don’t we just use a graphing calculator or computer to graph a curve? Why do we need to use calculus? It’s true that modern technology is capable of producing very accurate graphs. But even the best graphing devices have to be used intelligently. The use of calculus en- ables us to discover the most interesting aspects of curves and to detect behavior that we might otherwise overlook. We will see in Example 4 how calculus helps us to avoid the pitfalls of technology. GUIDELINES FOR SKETCHING A CURVE The following checklist is intended as a guide to sketching a curve by hand. Not every item is relevant to every function. (For instance, a given curve might not have an asymptote or possess symmetry.) But the guidelines provide all the informa- tion you need to make a sketch that displays the most important aspects of the function. A.

Symmetry (i) If for all in , that is, the equation of the curve is unchanged when is replaced by , then is an even function and the curve is symmetric about the -axis. This means that our work is cut in half. If we know what the curve looks like for , then we need only reflect about the -axis to obtain the complete curve [see Figure 1(a)]. Here are some examples: , and . (ii) If for all in , then is an odd function and the curve is symmetric about the origin. Again we can obtain the complete curve if we know what it looks like for .

If it turns out that (or ), then we do not have an asymptote to the right, but that is still useful information for sketching the curve. (ii) Vertical Asymptotes. Recall from Section 1.6 that the line is a ver- tical asymptote if at least one of the following statements is true: (For rational functions you can locate the vertical asymptotes by equating the denominator to 0 after canceling any common factors. But for other functions this method does not apply.) Furthermore, in sketching the curve it is very useful to know exactly which of the statements in (1) is true. If is not defined but is an endpoint of the domain of , then you should compute or , whether or not this limit is infinite. E. Intervals of Increase or Decrease Use the I / D Test.

Concavity and Points of Inflection Compute and use the Concavity Test. The curve is concave upward where and concave downward where . Inflection points occur where the direction of concavity changes. H. S ketch the Curve Using the information in items A–G, draw the graph. Sketch the asymptotes as dashed lines. Plot the intercepts, maximum and minimum points, and inflection points. Then make the curve pass through these points, rising and falling according to E, with concavity according to G, and approaching the asymptotes. If additional accuracy is desired near any point, you can compute the value of the derivative there. The tangent indicates the direction in which the curve proceeds. EXAMPLE 1 Use the guidelines to sketch the curve . A. The domain is B. The - and -intercepts are both 0. C. Since , the function is even.

SOLUTION If we specify a domain but not a range, many graphing devices will deduce a suitable range from the values computed. Figure 8 shows the plot from one such device if we specify that . Although this viewing rectangle is use- ful for showing that the asymptotic behavior (or end behavior) is the same as for , it is obviously hiding some finer detail. So we change to the viewing rect- angle by shown in Figure 9. From this graph it appears that there is an absolute minimum value of about 3 when (by using the cursor) and is decreasing on and increasing on . Also there appears to be a horizontal tangent at the origin and inflection points when and when is somewhere between and . Now let’s try to confirm these impressions using calculus. We differentiate and get When we graph in Figure 10 we see that changes from negative to positive when ; this confirms (by the First Derivative Test) the minimum value that we found earlier. But, perhaps to our surprise, we also notice that changes from positive to negative when and from negative to positive when . This means that has a local maximum at 0 and a local minimum when , but these were hidden in Figure 9. Indeed, if we now zoom in toward the origin in Figure 11, we see what we missed before: a local maximum value of 0 when and a local minimum value of about when .

A businessperson wants to minimize costs and maximize profits. A traveler wants to minimize transportation time. Fermat’s Principle in optics states that light follows the path that takes the least time. In this section and the next we solve such problems as maximizing areas, volumes, and profits and min- imizing distances, times, and costs. In solving such practical problems the greatest challenge is often to convert the word problem into a mathematical optimization problem by setting up the function that is to be maximized or minimized. The following steps may be useful. 1. Understand the Problem The first step is to read the problem carefully until it is clearly understood. Ask yourself: What is the unknown?

EXAMPLE 1 A farmer has 2400 ft of fencing and wants to fence off a rectangular field that borders a straight river. He needs no fence along the river. What are the dimensions of the field that has the largest area? SOLUTION In order to get a feeling for what is happening in this problem, let’s experiment with some special cases. Figure 1 (not to scale) shows three possible ways of laying out the 2400 ft of fencing. We see that when we try shallow, wide fields or deep, narrow fields, we get relatively small areas. It seems plausible that there is some intermediate configuration that produces the largest area. Figure 2 illustrates the general case. We wish to maximize the area of the rect- angle. Let and be the depth and width of the rectangle (in feet). Then we express in terms of and : We want to express as a function of just one variable, so we eliminate by expressing it in terms of .

Find the dimen- sions that will minimize the cost of the metal to manufacture the can. SOLUTION Draw the diagram as in Figure 3, where is the radius and the height (both in centimeters). In order to minimize the cost of the metal, we minimize the total surface area of the cylinder (top, bottom, and sides). From Figure 4 we see that the sides are made from a rectangular sheet with dimensions and h . So the surface area is To eliminate we use the fact that the volume is given as 1 L, which we take to be 1000 cm . Thus which gives .

If units are sold and the price per unit is , then the total revenue is and is called the revenue function . The derivative of the revenue function is called the marginal revenue function and is the rate of change of revenue with respect to the number of units sold.

The geometry behind Newton’s method is shown in Figure 2, where the root that we are trying to find is labeled . We start with a first approximation , which is obtained by guessing, or from a rough sketch of the graph of , or from a computer- generated graph of f . Consider the tangent line to the curve at the point and look at the -intercept of , labeled . The idea behind Newton’s method is that the tangent line is close to the curve and so its x -intercept, , is close to the x -intercept of the curve (namely, the root r that we are seeking). Because the tangent is a line, we can easily find its x -intercept. To find a formula for in terms of we use the fact that the slope of L is , so its equation is Since the -intercept of is , we set and obtain If , we can solve this equation for : We use as a second approximation to r . Next we repeat this procedure with replaced by , using the tangent line at . This gives a third approximation: If we keep repeating this process, we obtain a sequence of approximations as shown in Figure 3.

      "text": "AREAS AND DISTANCES In this section we discover that in trying to find the area under a curve or the distance traveled by a car, we end up with the same special type of limit. THE AREA PROBLEM We begin by attempting to solve the area problem: Find the area of the region that lies under the curve from to . This means that , illustrated in Figure 1, is bounded by the graph of a continuous function [where ], the vertical lines and , and the -axis. In trying to solve the area problem we have to ask ourselves: What is the meaning of the word area ? This question is easy to answer for regions with straight sides. For a rectangle, the area is defined as the product of the length and the width. The area of a triangle is half the base times the height. The area of a polygon is found by dividing it into triangles (as in Figure 2) and adding the areas of the triangles. However, it isn’t so easy to find the area of a region with curved sides. We all have an intuitive idea of what the area of a region is. But part of the area problem is to make this intuitive idea precise by giving an exact definition of area. Recall that in defining a tangent we first approximated the slope of the tangent line by slopes of secant lines and then we took the limit of these approximations. We pur- sue a similar idea for areas. We first approximate the region by rectangles and then we take the limit of the areas of these rectangles as we increase the number of rect- angles.

In much the same way, this chapter starts with the area and dis- tance problems and uses them to formulate the idea of a definite integral, which is the basic concept of integral calculus.We will see in Chapter 7 how to use the integral to solve problems concerning volumes, lengths of curves, work, forces on a dam, and centers of mass, among many others.

We can approximate each strip by a rectangle whose base is the same as the strip and whose height is the same as the right edge of the strip [see Figure 4(b)]. In other words, the heights of these rectangles are the values of the function at the right endpoints of the subintervals , , , and . Each rectangle has width and the heights are , , , and . If we let be the sum of the areas of these approximating rectangles, we get From Figure 4(b) we see that the area A of S is less than , so Instead of using the rectangles in Figure 4(b) we could use the smaller rectangles in Figure 5 whose heights are the values of at the left endpoints of the subintervals. (The leftmost rectangle has collapsed because its height is 0.) The sum of the areas of these approximating rectangles is We see that the area of S is larger than , so we have lower and upper estimates for A : We can repeat this procedure with a larger number of strips.

      "text": "By computing the sum of the areas of the smaller rectangles and the sum of the areas of the larger rectangles , we obtain better lower and upper estimates for A : So one possible answer to the question is to say that the true area of S lies some- where between 0.2734375 and 0.3984375. We could obtain better estimates by increasing the number of strips. The table at the left shows the results of similar calculations (with a computer) using n rect- angles whose heights are found with left endpoints or right endpoints . In particular, we see by using 50 strips that the area lies between 0.3234 and 0.3434. With 1000 strips we narrow it down even more: A lies between 0.3328335 and 0.3338335. A good estimate is obtained by averaging these numbers: . ■ From the values in the table in Example 1, it looks as if is approaching as n increases. We confirm this in the next example. EXAMPLE 2 For the region S in Example 1, show that the sum of the areas of the upper approximating rectangles approaches , that is, SOLUTION is the sum of the areas of the rectangles in Figure 7.

DEFINITION The area A of the region S that lies under the graph of the continuous function is the limit of the sum of the areas of approximating rectangles: It can be proved that the limit in Definition 2 always exists, since we are assuming that is continuous. It can also be shown that we get the same value if we use left endpoints: In fact, instead of using left endpoints or right endpoints, we could take the height of the i th rectangle to be the value of f at any number in the i th subinterval . We call the numbers , , . . . , the sample points . Figure 13 shows approxi- mating rectangles when the sample points are not chosen to be endpoints.

Thus From Figure 15 it appears that this estimate is better than the estimate with . ■ THE DISTANCE PROBLEM Now let’s consider the distance problem: Find the distance traveled by an object dur- ing a certain time period if the velocity of the object is known at all times. (In a sense this is the inverse problem of the velocity problem that we discussed in Section 2.1.) If the velocity remains constant, then the distance problem is easy to solve by means of the formula But if the velocity varies, it’s not so easy to find the distance traveled. We investigate the problem in the following example. EXAMPLE 4 Suppose the odometer on our car is broken and we want to estimate the distance driven over a 30-second time interval. We take speedometer readings every five seconds and record them in the following table: In order to have the time and the velocity in consistent units, let’s convert the veloc- ity readings to feet per second (1 mi \b h \u0002 5280 \b 3600 ft \b s): During the first five seconds the velocity doesn’t change very much, so we can esti- mate the distance traveled during that time by assuming that the velocity is constant.

Then our estimate becomes If we had wanted a more accurate estimate, we could have taken velocity readings every two seconds, or even every second. ■ Perhaps the calculations in Example 4 remind you of the sums we used earlier to estimate areas.

Similarly, the distance traveled during the second time interval is about and the total dis- tance traveled during the time interval is approximately If we use the velocity at right endpoints instead of left endpoints, our estimate for the total distance becomes The more frequently we measure the velocity, the more accurate our estimates become, so it seems plausible that the exact distance d traveled is the limit of such expressions: We will see in Section 5.3 that this is indeed true. d \u0002 lim n l \u0014 n i \u0002 1 f \u0002 t i \u0002 1 \u0003 \u0013 t \u0002 lim n l \u0014 n i \u0002 1 f \u0002 t i \u0003 \u0013 t 5 f \u0002 t 1 \u0003 \u0013 t \u0003 f \u0002 t 2 \u0003 \u0013 t \u0003 \u0003 f \u0002 t n \u0003 \u0013 t \u0002 \u0014 n i \u0002 1 f \u0002 t i \u0003 \u0013 t f \u0002 t 0 \u0003 \u0013 t \u0003 f \u0002 t 1 \u0003 \u0013 t \u0003 \u0003 f \u0002 t n \u0002 1 \u0003 \u0013 t \u0002 \u0014 n i \u0002 1 f \u0002 t i \u0002 1 \u0003 \u0013 t a , b f \u0002 t 1 \u0003 \u0013 t f \u0002 t 0 \u0003 \u0013 t f \u0002 t 0 \u0003 \u0013 t \u0002 \u0002 b \u0002 a \u0003\b n t 0 \u0002 \u0002 a \u0003 , t 1, t 2 , . . . , t n \u0002 \u0002 b \u0003 f \u0002 t \u0003 \u000e 0 a t b v \u0002 f \u0002 t \u0003 L 6 \u0002 1135 25 5 \u0002 125 \u0002 31 5 \u0003 \u0003 \u0002 35 5 \u0003 \u0003 \u0002 43 5 \u0003 \u0003 \u0002 47 5 \u0003 \u0003 \u0002 46 5 \u0003 \u0003 \u0002 41 5 \u0003"

When Leibniz chose the notation for an integral, he chose the ingredients as reminders of the limit- ing process. In general, when we write we replace by , by x , and by dx . NOTE 3 If happens to be positive, then the Riemann sum can be interpreted as a sum of areas of approximating rectangles (see Figure 3). By comparing Theorem 4 with the definition of area in Section 5.1, we see that the definite integral can be interpreted as the area under the curve from a to b. (See Figure 4.) If takes on both positive and negative values, as in Figure 5, then the Riemann sum is the sum of the areas of the rectangles that lie above the -axis and the nega- tives of the areas of the rectangles that lie below the -axis (the areas of the dark blue rectangles minus the areas of the light blue rectangles). When we take the limit of such Riemann sums, we get the situation illustrated in Figure 6. A definite integral can be interpreted as a net area , that is, a difference of areas: where is the area of the region above the -axis and below the graph of , and is the area of the region below the -axis and above the graph of .

Property 2 says that the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals. For positive functions it says that the area under is the area under plus the area under t . Figure 15 helps us understand why this is true: In view of how graphical addition works, the corresponding vertical line segments have equal height. In general, Property 2 follows from Theorem 4 and the fact that the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits: Property 3 can be proved in a similar manner and says that the integral of a con- stant times a function is the constant times the integral of the function.

For instance, we know from Section 4.7 that an antiderivative of is , so the Evaluation Theorem tells us that Comparing this method with the calculation in Example 2 in Section 5.1, where we found the area under the parabola from 0 to 1 by computing a limit of sums, we see that the Evaluation Theorem provides us with a simple and powerful method. Although the Evaluation Theorem may be surprising at first glance, it becomes plausible if we interpret it in physical terms. If is the velocity of an object and is its position at time t , then , so s is an antiderivative of . In Section 5.1 we considered an object that always moves in the positive direction and made the guess that the area under the velocity curve is equal to the distance traveled.

      "text": "means | You should distinguish carefully between definite and indefinite integrals. A def- inite integral is a number , whereas an indefinite integral is a func- tion (or family of functions). The connection between them is given by the Evaluation Theorem: If is continuous on , then Recall from Section 4.7 that if is an antiderivative of on an interval , then the most general antiderivative of on is , where is an arbitrary constant. For instance, the formula is valid (on any interval that doesn’t contain 0) because . So an indefinite integral can represent either a particular antiderivative of or an entire family of antiderivatives (one for each value of the constant ). The effectiveness of the Evaluation Theorem depends on having a supply of anti- derivatives of functions. We therefore restate the Table of Antidifferentiation Formulas from Section 4.7, together with a few others, in the notation of indefinite integrals. Any formula can be verified by differentiating the function on the right side and obtaining the integrand.

In Section 5.1 we guessed that this was true for the case where the object moves in the positive direction, but now we have proved that it is always true. ■ If we want to calculate the distance traveled during the time interval, we have to consider the intervals when (the particle moves to the right) and also the intervals when (the particle moves to the left). In both cases the distance is computed by integrating , the speed. Therefore Figure 4 shows how both displacement and distance traveled can be inter- preted in terms of areas under a velocity curve. ■ The acceleration of the object is , so is the change in velocity from time to time . EXAMPLE 7 A particle moves along a line so that its velocity at time is (measured in meters per second). (a) Find the displacement of the particle during the time period . (b) Find the distance traveled during this time period.

      "text": "THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is appropriately named because it establishes a connection between the two branches of calculus: differential calculus and integral calculus. Differential calculus arose from the tangent problem, whereas integral cal- culus arose from a seemingly unrelated problem, the area problem. Newton’s teacher at Cambridge, Isaac Barrow (1630–1677), discovered that these two problems are actually closely related. In fact, he realized that differentiation and integration are inverse processes. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gives the precise inverse relationship between the derivative and the integral. It was Newton and Leibniz who exploited this relationship and used it to develop calculus into a systematic mathe- matical method. The first part of the Fundamental Theorem deals with functions defined by an equa- tion of the form where is a continuous function on and varies between and . Observe that depends only on , which appears as the variable upper limit in the integral. If is a fixed number, then the integral is a definite number. If we then let vary, the number also varies and defines a function of denoted by . If happens to be a positive function, then can be interpreted as the area under the graph of from to , where can vary from to . (Think of as the “area so far” function; see Figure 1.)

The Product Rule states that if and are differentiable functions, then In the notation for indefinite integrals this equation becomes or y f \u0002 x \u0003 t \u0012 \u0002 x \u0003 dx \u0003 y t \u0002 x \u0003 f \u0012 \u0002 x \u0003 dx \u0002 f \u0002 x \u0003 t \u0002 x \u0003 y f \u0002 x \u0003 t \u0012 \u0002 x \u0003 \u0003 t \u0002 x \u0003 f \u0012 \u0002 x \u0003 dx \u0002 f \u0002 x \u0003 t \u0002 x \u0003 d dx f \u0002 x \u0003 t \u0002 x \u0003 \u0002 f \u0002 x \u0003 t \u0012 \u0002 x \u0003 \u0003 t \u0002 x \u0003 f \u0012 \u0002 x \u0003 t f 6.1 TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION Because of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we can integrate a function if we know an anti- derivative, that is, an indefinite integral.We summarize here the most important integrals that we have learned so far. , In this chapter we develop techniques for using these basic integration formulas to obtain indefinite integrals of more complicated functions.We learned the most important method of integration, the Substitution Rule, in Section 5.5.The other general technique, integration by parts, is presented in Section 6.1.Then we learn methods that are special to particular classes of func- tions such as trigonometric functions and rational functions. a \u0007 0 y 1 s a 2 \u0002 x 2 dx \u0002 sin \u0002 1 \u0004 x a \u0005 \u0003 C y 1 x 2 \u0003 a 2 dx \u0002 1 a tan \u0002 1 \u0004 x a \u0005 \u0003 C y cot x dx \u0002 ln \u0006 sin x \u0006 \u0003 C y tan x dx \u0002 ln \u0006 sec x \u0006 \u0003 C y cosh x dx \u0002 sinh x \u0003 C"

In general we can make a substitution of the form by using the Substitution Rule in reverse. To make our calculations simpler, we assume that has an inverse function; that is, is one-to-one. In this case, if we replace by and by in the Substitution Rule (Equation 5.5.4), we obtain This kind of substitution is called inverse substitution. We can make the inverse substitution provided that it defines a one-to- one function. We accomplish this by restricting to lie in the interval . In the following table we list trigonometric substitutions that are effective for the given radical expressions because of the specified trigonometric identities. In each case the restriction on is imposed to ensure that the function that defines the substitution is one-to-one.

TABLES OF INTEGRALS Tables of indefinite integrals are very useful when we are confronted by an integral that is difficult to evaluate by hand and we don’t have access to a computer algebra system. A relatively brief table of 120 integrals, categorized by form, is provided on the Reference Pages at the back of the book. More extensive tables are available in CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulae, 31st ed, by Daniel Zwillinger (Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, 2002) (709 entries) or in Gradshteyn and Ryzhik’s Table of Integrals, Series, and Products, 6e, edited by A. Jefferey and D. Zwillinger (San Diego: Academic Press, 2000), which contains hundreds of pages of integrals. It should be remembered, however, that integrals do not often occur in exactly the form listed in a table. Usually we need to use the Substitution Rule or algebraic manipulation to transform a given integral into one of the forms in the table. EXAMPLE 1 Use the Table of Integrals to find . SOLUTION If we look at the section of the table entitled Forms involving , we see that the closest entry is number 34: y u 2 s a 2 \u0002 u 2 du \u0002 \u0002 u 2 s"

Computers are particularly good at matching patterns. And just as we used substitutions in conjunction with tables, a CAS can perform substitutions that transform a given integral into one that occurs in its stored formulas. So it isn’t surprising that computer algebra systems excel at integra- tion. That doesn’t mean that integration by hand is an obsolete skill. We will see that a hand computation sometimes produces an indefinite integral in a form that is more convenient than a machine answer. To begin, let’s see what happens when we ask a machine to integrate the relatively simple function . Using the substitution , an easy calcula- tion by hand gives whereas Derive, Mathematica, and Maple all return the answer The first thing to notice is that computer algebra systems omit the constant of integra- tion. In other words, they produce a particular antiderivative, not the most general one. Therefore, when making use of a machine integration, we might have to add a constant. Second, the absolute value signs are omitted in the machine answer. That is fine if our problem is concerned only with values of greater than .

Indeed, if we ask Derive, Maple, and Mathematica to simplify their expressions using trigonometric identities, they ultimately produce the same form of the answer as in Equation 1. ■ CAN WE INTEGRATE ALL CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS ? The question arises: Will our basic integration formulas, together with the Substitution Rule, integration by parts, tables of integrals, and computer algebra systems, enable us to find the integral of every continuous function? In particular, can we use it to eval- uate ? The answer is No, at least not in terms of the functions that we are famil- iar with. Most of the functions that we have been dealing with in this book are what are called elementary functions . These are the polynomials, rational functions, power functions , exponential functions , logarithmic functions, trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions, and all functions that can be obtained from these by the five operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and composition. For instance, the function is an elementary function. If is an elementary function, then is an elementary function but need not be an elementary function. Consider .

There may be no formula for the function (see Example 5). In both cases we need to find approximate values of definite integrals. We already know one such method. Recall that the definite integral is defined as a limit of Rie- mann sums, so any Riemann sum could be used as an approximation to the integral: If we divide into subintervals of equal length , then we have where is any point in the th subinterval . If is chosen to be the left end- point of the interval, then and we have If , then the integral represents an area and (1) represents an approximation of this area by the rectangles shown in Figure 1(a). If we choose to be the right end- point, then and we have [See Figure 1(b).] The approximations and defined by Equations 1 and 2 are called the left endpoint approximation and right endpoint approximation , respectively. In Section 5.2 we also considered the case where is chosen to be the midpoint of the subinterval . Figure 1(c) shows the midpoint approximation , which appears to be better than either or .

Some of these machines use Simpson’s Rule; others use more sophisticated techniques such as adaptive numerical integration. This means that if a function fluctuates much more on a certain part of the interval than it does elsewhere, then that part gets divided into more subintervals. This strategy reduces the number of calculations required to achieve a prescribed accuracy. ■ Figure 10 illustrates the calculation in Example 7. Notice that the parabolic arcs are so close to the graph of that they are practically indistinguish- able from it. y \u0002 e x 2 0 y x 1 y=e x 2 FIGURE 10"

In such cases the follow- ing theorem is useful. Although we state it for Type 1 integrals, a similar theorem is true for Type 2 integrals. COMPARISON THEOREM Suppose that and are continuous functions with for . (a) If is convergent, then is convergent. (b) If is divergent, then is divergent.

Finally we evaluate the integral by using the Evaluation Theorem, or Simpson’s Rule, or technology. In the final section we look at what is perhaps the most important of all the applications of integration: differential equations.When a scientist uses calculus, more often than not it is to solve a differential equation that has arisen in the description of some physical process.

We start with a simple type of solid called a cylinder (or, more precisely, a right cylinder ). As illustrated in Figure 1(a), a cylinder is bounded by a plane region , called the base , and a congruent region in a parallel plane.

For instance, let’s consider the problem of finding the volume of the solid obtained by rotating about the -axis the region bounded by and . (See Figure 1.) If we slice perpendicular to the y -axis, we get a washer. But to com- pute the inner radius and the outer radius of the washer, we would have to solve the cubic equation for x in terms of y ; that’s not easy. Fortunately, there is a method, called the method of cylindrical shells , that is eas- ier to use in such a case. Figure 2 shows a cylindrical shell with inner radius , outer radius , and height .

      "text": "ARC LENGTH What do we mean by the length of a curve? We might think of fitting a piece of string to the curve in Figure 1 and then measuring the string against a ruler. But that might be difficult to do with much accuracy if we have a complicated curve. We need a pre- cise definition for the length of an arc of a curve, in the same spirit as the definitions we developed for the concepts of area and volume. If the curve is a polygon, we can easily find its length; we just add the lengths of the line segments that form the polygon. (We can use the distance formula to find the distance between the endpoints of each segment.) We are going to define the length of a general curve by first approximating it by a polygon and then taking a limit as the number of segments of the polygon is increased. This process is familiar for the case of a circle, where the circumference is the limit of lengths of inscribed polygons (see Figure 2). Now suppose that a curve is defined by the equation , where f is con- tinuous and . We obtain a polygonal approximation to by dividing the interval into n subintervals with endpoints and equal width . If , then the point lies on and the polygon with vertices , , . . . , , illustrated in Figure 3, is an approximation to .

(See Figure 4, where the arc of the curve between and has been magnified and approximations with successively smaller values of are shown.) Therefore, we define the length of the curve with equation , , as the limit of the lengths of these inscribed polygons (if the limit exists): Notice that the procedure for defining arc length is very similar to the procedure we used for defining area and volume: We divided the curve into a large number of small parts.

As with our pre- vious applications to geometry (areas, volumes, and lengths), our strategy is to break up the physical quantity into a large number of small parts, approximate each small part, add the results, take the limit, and evaluate the resulting integral. WORK The term work is used in everyday language to mean the total amount of effort required to perform a task. In physics it has a technical meaning that depends on the idea of a force. Intuitively, you can think of a force as describing a push or pull on an object—for example, a horizontal push of a book across a table or the downward pull of the Earth’s gravity on a ball. In general, if an object moves along a straight line with position function , then the force F on the object (in the same direction) is defined by Newton’s Second Law of Motion as the product of its mass and its acceleration: In the SI metric system, the mass is measured in kilograms (kg), the displacement in meters (m), the time in seconds (s), and the force in newtons ( ).

Thus a force of 1 N acting on a mass of 1 kg produces an acceleration of 1 m \b s . In the US Customary system the fundamental unit is chosen to be the unit of force, which is the pound. In the case of constant acceleration, the force is also constant and the work done is defined to be the product of the force and the distance that the object moves: If is measured in newtons and in meters, then the unit for is a newton-meter, W d F work \u0002 force distance W \u0002 Fd 2 d F F 2 N \u0002 kg m \b s 2 F \u0002 m d 2 s dt 2 1 m s \u0002 t \u0003 7.5 ■ As a consequence of a calculation of work, you will be able to compute the velocity needed for a rocket to escape the Earth’s gravitational field.

For instance, suppose you lift a 1.2-kg book off the floor to put it on a desk that is 0.7 m high. The force you exert is equal and opposite to that exerted by gravity, so Equation 1 gives and then Equation 2 gives the work done as But if a 20-lb weight is lifted 6 ft off the ground, then the force is given as lb, so the work done is Here we didn’t multiply by because we were given the weight (a force) and not the mass.

The first integral can be evaluated using the trigonometric substitution , but it’s simpler to observe that it is the area of a semicircular disk with radius 3.

We first consider the simpler situation illustrated in Figure 10, where two masses and are attached to a rod of negligible mass on opposite sides of a fulcrum and at distances and from the fulcrum. The rod will balance if This is an experimental fact discovered by Archimedes and called the Law of the Lever.

If we compare Figures 10 and 11, we see that and and so Equation 6 gives The numbers and are called the moments of the masses and (with respect to the origin), and Equation 7 says that the center of mass is obtained by adding the moments of the masses and dividing by the total mass .

      "text": "In each of these differential equations is an unknown function . The importance of differential equations lies in the fact that when a scientist or engineer formulates a physical law in mathematical terms, it frequently turns out to be a differential equation. The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative that occurs in the equation. Thus Equations 1, 2, and 3 are of order 1, 2, and 3, respectively. A function is called a solution of a differential equation if the equation is satis- fied when and its derivatives are substituted into the equation. Thus is a solu- tion of Equation 1 if for all values of x in some interval. When we are asked to solve a differential equation we are expected to find all possible solutions of the equation. We have already solved some particularly simple differential equations, namely, those of the form . For instance, we know that the general solution of the differential equation is given by , where C is an arbitrary constant. But, in general, solving a differential equation is not an easy matter. There is no systematic technique that enables us to solve all differential equations. In this section we learn how to solve a certain type of differential equation called a separable equa- tion .

However, in a restricted environment and with limited food supply, the population cannot exceed a maximal size (called the carrying capacity ) at which it consumes its entire food supply. If we make the assumption that the rate of growth of population is jointly proportional to the size of the population and the amount by which falls short of the maximal size , then we have the equation where is a constant. Equation 7 is called the logistic differential equation and was used by the Dutch mathematical biologist Pierre-François Verhulst in the 1840s to model world population growth.

The graph of the logistic growth function is shown in Figure 4. At first the graph is concave upward and the growth curve appears to be almost exponential, but then it is concave downward and approaches the limiting population . MIXING PROBLEMS A typical mixing problem involves a tank of fixed capacity filled with a thoroughly mixed solution of some substance, such as salt. A solution of a given concentration enters the tank at a fixed rate and the mixture, thoroughly stirred, leaves at a fixed rate, which may differ from the entering rate. If denotes the amount of substance in the tank at time t , then is the rate at which the substance is being added minus the rate at which it is being removed. The mathematical description of this situation often leads to a first-order separable differential equation. We can use the same type of rea- soning to model a variety of phenomena: chemical reactions, discharge of pollutants into a lake, injection of a drug into the bloodstream. EXAMPLE 5 A tank contains 20 kg of salt dissolved in 5000 L of water. Brine that contains 0.03 kg of salt per liter of water enters the tank at a rate of 25 L \b min.

(One of our aims in this chapter is to define exactly what is meant by an infinite sum.) Their importance in calculus stems from Newton’s idea of representing functions as sums of infinite series. For instance, in finding areas he often integrated a function by first expressing it as a series and then integrating each term of the series. We will pursue his idea in Section 8.7 in order to integrate such functions as . (Recall that we have previously been unable to do this.) Many of the functions that arise in mathematical physics and chemistry, such as Bessel functions, are defined as sums of series, so it is important to be familiar with the basic concepts of convergence of infinite sequences and series. Physicists also use series in another way, as we will see in Section 8.8. In studying fields as diverse as optics, special relativity, and electromagnetism, they analyze phenomena by replacing a function with the first few terms in the series that represents it. e \u0002 x 2 8 410"

If is increasing and for all , then the terms are forced to crowd together and approach some number . The proof of Theorem 11 is based on the Completeness Axiom for the set of real numbers, which says that if is a nonempty set of real numbers that has an upper bound ( for all in ), then has a least upper bound . (This means that is an upper bound for , but if is any other upper bound, then .) The Completeness Axiom is an expression of the fact that there is no gap or hole in the real number line. MONOTONIC SEQUENCE THEOREM Every bounded, monotonic sequence is convergent. PROOF Suppose is an increasing sequence. Since is bounded, the set has an upper bound. By the Completeness Axiom it has a least upper bound . Given , is not an upper bound for (since is the least upper bound). Therefore But the sequence is increasing so for every . Thus if we have so since . Thus so . A similar proof (using the greatest lower bound) works if is decreasing. ■ The proof of Theorem 11 shows that a sequence that is increasing and bounded above is convergent.

It would be impossible to find a finite sum for the series because if we start adding the terms we get the cumulative sums 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, . . . and, after the term, we get , which becomes very large as increases. However, if we start to add the terms of the series we get , , , , , , . . . , , . . . . The table shows that as we add more and more terms, these partial sums become closer and closer to 1. In fact, by adding suf- ficiently many terms of the series we can make the partial sums as close as we like to 1.

      "text": "We use a similar idea to determine whether or not a general series (1) has a sum. We consider the partial sums and, in general, These partial sums form a new sequence , which may or may not have a limit. If exists (as a finite number), then, as in the preceding example, we call it the sum of the infinite series . DEFINITION Given a series , let denote its th partial sum: If the sequence is convergent and exists as a real number, then the series is called convergent and we write The number is called the sum of the series. If the sequence is divergent, then the series is called divergent . Thus the sum of a series is the limit of the sequence of partial sums. So when we write we mean that by adding sufficiently many terms of the series we can get as close as we like to the number .

Similarly, if it is known that the series converges, then the full series is also convergent. \u0014 n \u0002 1 a n \u0002 \u0014 N n \u0002 1 a n \u0003 \u0014 n \u0002 N \u0003 1 a n \u0015 n \u0002 N \u0003 1 a n \u0015 n \u0002 1 n \b\u0002 n 3 \u0003 1 \u0003 \u0014 n \u0002 1 n n 3 \u0003 1 \u0002 1 2 \u0003 2 9 \u0003 3 28 \u0003 \u0014 n \u0002 4 n n 3 \u0003 1 \u0014 n \u0002 4 n n 3 \u0003 1 \u0002 3 \u0002 1 \u0003 1 \u0002 4 \u0014 n \u0002 1 \u0004 3 n \u0002 n \u0003 1 \u0003 \u0003 1 2 n \u0005 \u0002 3 \u0014 n \u0002 1 1 n \u0002 n \u0003 1 \u0003 \u0003 \u0014 n \u0002 1 1 2 n \u0014 n \u0002 1 1 n \u0002 n \u0003 1 \u0003 \u0002 1 \u0014 n \u0002 1 1 2 n \u0002 1 2 1 \u0002 1 2 \u0002 1 r \u0002 1 2 a \u0002 1 2 \u0015 1 \b 2 n \u0014 n \u0002 1 \u0004 3 n \u0002 n \u0003 1 \u0003 \u0003 1 2 n \u0005 \u0014 n \u0002 1 \u0002 a n \u0003 b n \u0003 \u0002 s \u0003 t \u0002 \u0014 n \u0002 1 a n \u0003 \u0014 n \u0002 1 bn \u0015 \u0002 a n \u0003 b n \u0003 \u0002 lim n l s n \u0003 lim n l t n \u0002 s \u0003 t \u0002 lim n l \u0014 n i \u0002 1 ai \u0003 lim n l \u0014 n i \u0002 1 bi lim n l u n \u0002 lim n l \u0014 n i \u0002 1 \u0002 a i \u0003 b i \u0003 \u0002 lim n l \u0004 \u0014 n i \u0002 1 ai \u0003 \u0014 n i \u0002 1 bi \u0005 un \u0002 \u0014 n i \u0002 1 \u0002 a i \u0003 b i \u0003 \u0015 \u0002 a n \u0003 b n \u0003 t \u0002 \u0014 n \u0002 1 bn t n \u0002 \u0014 n i \u0002 1 bi s \u0002 \u0014 n \u0002 1 a n s n \u0002 \u0014 n i \u0002 1 a i 426 ■ CHAPTER 8 SERIES"

We were able to accomplish this for geometric series and the series because in each of those cases we could find a simple formula for the partial sum . But usually it isn’t easy to compute . Therefore, in this section and the next we develop tests that enable us to determine whether a series is convergent or divergent without explicitly finding its sum. In this section we deal only with series with positive terms, so the partial sums are increasing. In view of the Monotonic Sequence Theorem, to decide whether a series is convergent or divergent, we need to determine whether the partial sums are bounded or not. TESTING WITH AN INTEGRAL Let’s investigate the series whose terms are the reciprocals of the squares of the posi- tive integers: There’s no simple formula for the sum of the first terms, but the computer- generated table of values given in the margin suggests that the partial sums are ap- proaching a number near 1.64 as and so it loo"

The base of each rectangle is an interval of length 1; the height is equal to the value of the function at the right endpoint of the interval. So the sum of the areas of the rectangles is If we exclude the first rectangle, the total area of the remaining rectangles is smaller than the area under the curve for , which is the value of the integral . In Section 6.6 we discovered that this improper integral is con- vergent and has value 1. So the picture shows that all the partial sums are less than Thus the partial sums are bounded and the series converges. The sum of the series (the limit of the partial sums) is also less than 2: [The exact sum of this series was found by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) to be , but the proof of this fact is beyond the scope of this book.] Now let’s look at the series The table of values of suggests that the partial sums aren’t approaching a finite number, so we suspect that the given series may be divergent.

But we know from Section 6.6 that this improper integral is divergent. In other words, the area under the curve is infinite. So the sum of the series must be infinite, that is, the series is divergent. The same sort of geometric reasoning that we used for these two series can be used to prove the following test.

TESTING BY COMPARING The series reminds us of the series , which is a geometric series with and and is therefore convergent. Because the series (2) is so similar to a convergent series, we have the feeling that it too must be convergent. Indeed, it is. The inequality shows that our given series (2) has smaller terms than those of the geometric series and therefore all its partial sums are also smaller than 1 (the sum of the geometric series). This means that its partial sums form a bounded increasing sequence, which is convergent.

      "text": "438 ■ CHAPTER 8 SERIES The following test says that if the terms of an alternating series decrease to 0 in absolute value, then the series converges. THE ALTERNATING SERIES TEST If the alternating series satisfies (i) (ii) then the series is convergent. Before giving the proof let’s look at Figure 1, which gives a picture of the idea behind the proof. We first plot on a number line. To find we subtract , so is to the left of . Then to find we add , so is to the right of . But, since , is to the left of . Continuing in this manner, we see that the partial sums oscillate back and forth. Since , the successive steps are becoming smaller and smaller. The even partial sums , , , . . . are increasing and the odd partial sums , , , . . . are decreasing. Thus it seems plausible that both are converging to some number , which is the sum of the series. Therefore, in the following proof we con- sider the even and odd partial sums separately. PROOF OF THE ALTERNATING SERIES TEST We first consider the even partial sums: In general Thus But we can also write Every term in brackets is positive, so for all . Therefore, the sequence of even partial sums is increasing and bounded above. It is therefore convergent by the Monotonic Sequence Theorem.

This strategy is useful for integrating functions that don’t have elementary antiderivatives, for solving differential equations, and for approximating functions by polynomials. (Scientists do this to simplify the expres- sions they deal with; computer scientists do this to represent functions on calculators and computers.)

We would like to be able to differentiate and inte- grate such functions, and the following theorem (which we won’t prove) says that we can do so by differentiating or integrating each individual term in the series, just as we would for a polynomial. This is called term-by-term differentiation and integration . THEOREM If the power series has radius of convergence , then the function defined by is differentiable (and therefore continuous) on the interval and (i) (ii) The radii of convergence of the power series in Equations (i) and (ii) are both . NOTE 1 Equations (i) and (ii) in Theorem 2 can be rewritten in the form (iii) (iv) We know that, for finite sums, the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives and the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals. Equations (iii) and (iv) assert that the same is true for infinite sums, provided we are dealing with power series. (For other types of series of functions the situation is not as simple; see Exercise 36.)

But the idea of representing particular functions as sums of power series goes back to Newton, and the general Taylor series was known to the Scottish mathemati- cian James Gregory in 1668 and to the Swiss mathematician John Bernoulli in the 1690s. Taylor was apparently unaware of the work of Gregory and Bernoulli when he published his discoveries on series in 1715 in his book Methodus incrementorum directa et inversa . Maclaurin series are named after Colin Maclaurin because he popularized them in his calculus textbook Treatise of Fluxions published in 1742."

Let’s investigate the more general question: Under what circumstances is a func- tion equal to the sum of its Taylor series? In other words, if has derivatives of all orders, when is it true that As with any convergent series, this means that is the limit of the sequence of par- tial sums.

One reason that Taylor series are important is that they enable us to integrate func- tions that we couldn’t previously handle. In fact, in the introduction to this chapter we mentioned that Newton often integrated functions by first expressing them as power series and then integrating the series term by term. The function can’t be integrated by techniques discussed so far because its antiderivative is not an elemen- tary function (see Section 6.4). In the following example we use Newton’s idea to inte- grate this function. EXAMPLE 9 (a) Evaluate as an infinite series. (b) Evaluate correct to within an error of . SOLUTION (a) First we find the Maclaurin series for . Although it’s possible to use the direct method, let’s find it simply by replacing with in the series for given in the table of Maclaurin series.

When using a Taylor polynomial to approximate a function , we have to ask the questions: How good an approximation is it? How large should we take to be in order to achieve a desired accuracy? To answer these questions we need to look at the absolute value of the remainder: There are three possible methods for estimating the size of the error: 1. If a graphing device is available, we can use it to graph and thereby estimate the error. 2. If the series happens to be an alternating series, we can use the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem. 3.

One use of the type of calculation done in Examples 1 and 2 occurs in calculators and computers. For instance, when you press the or key on your calculator, or when a computer programmer uses a subroutine for a trigonometric or exponential or Bessel function, in many machines a polynomial approximation is calculated. The polynomial is often a Taylor polynomial that has been modified so that the error is spread more evenly throughout an interval. APPLICATIONS TO PHYSICS Taylor polynomials are also used frequently in physics. In order to gain insight into an equation, a physicist often simplifies a function by considering only the first two or three terms in its Taylor series. In other words, the physicist uses a Taylor polynomial as an approximation to the function. Taylor’s Formula can then be used to gauge the accuracy of the approximation. The following example shows one way in which this idea is used in special relativity. EXAMPLE 3 In Einstein’s theory of special relativity the mass of an object mov- ing with velocity is where is the mass of the object when at rest and is the speed of light.

Notice that the consecutive points marked on the curve appear at equal time intervals but not at equal distances. That is because the particle slows down and then speeds up as increases. It appears from Figure 2 that the curve traced out by the particle may be a parabola. This can be confirmed by eliminating the parameter as follows. We obtain from the second equation and substitute into the first equation. This gives and so the curve represented by the given parametric equations is the parabola . ■ No restriction was placed on the parameter in Example 1, so we assumed that t could be any real number. But sometimes we restrict t to lie in a finite interval. For instance, the parametric curve shown in Figure 3 is the part of the parabola in Example 1 that starts at the point and ends at the point . The arrowhead indicates the direction in which the curve is traced as increases from 0 to 4. In general, the curve with parametric equations has initial point and terminal point .

Later this curve arose in connection with the brachistochrone problem: Find the curve along which a particle will slide in the shortest time (under the influence of gravity) from a point to a lower point not directly beneath . The Swiss math- ematician John Bernoulli, who posed this problem in 1696, showed that among all possible curves that join to , as in Figure 14, the particle will take the least time sliding from to if the curve is part of an inverted arch of a cycloid. The Dutch physicist Huygens had already shown that the cycloid is also the sol- ution to the tautochrone problem; that is, no matter where a particle is placed on an inverted cycloid, it takes the same time to slide to the bottom (see Figure 15). Huygens proposed that pendulum clocks (which he invented) should swing in cycloi- dal arcs because then the pendulum takes the same time to make a complete oscilla- tion whether it swings through a wide or a small arc.

The origin is also a point of intersection, but we can’t find it by solving the equations of the curves because the origin has no single representation in polar coordinates that satisfies both equations. Notice that, when represented as or , the origin satisfies and so it lies on the circle; when represented as , it satisfies and so it lies on the cardioid. Think of two points moving along the curves as the parameter value increases from 0 to . On one curve the origin is reached at and ; on the other curve it is reached at . The points don’t collide at the origin because they reach the origin at different times, but the curves intersect there nonetheless. Thus, to find all points of intersection of two polar curves, it is recommended that you draw the graphs of both curves. It is especially convenient to use a graphing cal- culator or computer to help with this task. \u0005 \u0002 3 \u0004 \b 2 \u0005 \u0002 \u0004 \u0005 \u0002 0 2 \u0004 \u0005 r \u0002 1 \u0003 sin \u0005 \u0002 0, 3 \u0004 \b 2 \u0003 r \u0002 3 sin \u0005 \u0002 0, \u0004 \u0003 \u0002 0, 0 \u0003 ( 3 2 , 5 \u0004 \b 6) ( 3 2 , \u0004 \b 6) r \u0002 1 \u0003 sin \u0005 r \u0002 3 sin \u0005 \u0002 1 2 y b a ( f \u0002 \u0005 \u0003 2 \u0002 t \u0002 \u0005 \u0003 2 ) d \u0005 A \u0002 y b a 1 2 f \u0002 \u0005 \u0003 2 d \u0005 \u0002 y b a 1 2 t \u0002 \u0005 \u0003 2 d \u0005 r \u0002 f \u0002 \u0005 \u0003 r \u0002 t \u0002 \u0005 \u0003 \u0003 A 0 \u0006 b \u0002 a 2 \u0004 f \u0002 \u0005 \u0003 \u000e t \u0002 \u0005 \u0003 \u000e 0 \u0005 \u0002 b \u0005 \u0002 a r \u0002 t \u0002 \u0005 \u0003 r \u0002 f \u0002 \u0005 \u0003 \u0003 \u0002 3 \u0005 \u0002 2 sin 2 \u0005 \u0003 2 cos \u0005 ] \u0004 \b 6 \u0004 \b 2 \u0002 \u0004 sin 2 \u0005 \u0002 1 2 \u0002 1 \u0002 cos 2 \u0005 \u0003 \u0002 y \u0004 \b 2 \u0004 \b 6 \u0002 3 \u0002 4 cos 2 \u0005 \u0002 2 sin \u0005 \u0003 d \u0005 \u0002 y \u0004 \b 2 \u0004 \b 6 \u0002 8 sin 2 \u0005 \u0002 1 \u0002 2 sin \u0005 \u0003 d \u0005 A \u0002 2 \u0013 1 2 y \u0004 \b 2"

CONICS IN CARTESIAN COORDINATES Here we provide a brief reminder of what you need to know about conic sections. A more thorough review can be found on the website www.stewartcalculus.com . Recall that a parabola is the set of points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point (called the focus ) and a fixed line (called the directrix ). This definition is illustrated by Figure 1. Notice that the point halfway between the focus and the directrix lies on the parabola; it is called the vertex . The line through the focus per- pendicular to the directrix is called the axis of the parabola. A parabola has a very simple equation if its vertex is placed at the origin and its directrix is parallel to the -axis or -axis. If the focus is on the -axis at the point , then the directrix has the equation and an equation of the parabola is . [See parts (a) and (b) of Figure 2.] If the focus is on the -axis at , then the directrix is and an equation is as in parts (c) and (d).

An ellipse has a simple equation if we place the foci on the -axis at the points and as in Figure 3 so that the origin is halfway between the foci. If the sum of the distances from a point on the ellipse to the foci is , then the points and where the ellipse meets the -axis are called the vertices . The -intercepts are , where . (See Figure 4.) The ellipse has foci , where , and vertices . If the foci of an ellipse are located on the -axis at , then we can find its equation by interchanging and in (1). A hyperbola is the set of all points in a plane the difference of whose distances from two fixed points and (the foci) is a constant. Notice that the definition of a hyperbola is similar to that of an ellipse; the only change is that the sum of dis- tances has become a difference of distances. If the foci are on the -axis at and the difference of distances is , then the equation of the hyperbola is , where . The -intercepts are and the points and are the vertices of the hyperbola. There is no -intercept and the hyperbola consists of two parts, called its branches. (See Figure 5.) When we draw a hyperbola it is useful to first draw its asymptotes , which are the dashed lines and shown in Figure 5. Both branches of the hyperbola approach the asymptotes; that is, they come arbitrarily close to the asymptotes."

The set of all points in the plane such that (that is, the ratio of the distance from to the distance from is the con- stant ) is a conic section. The conic is (a) (b) (c) PROOF Notice that if the eccentricity is , then and so the given condition simply becomes the definition of a parabola. Let us place the focus at the origin and the directrix parallel to the -axis and units to the right. Thus the directrix has equation and is perpendicular to the polar axis. If the point has polar coordinates , we see from Figure 7 that Thus the condition , or , becomes If we square both sides of this polar equation and convert to rectangular coordinates, we get or After completing the square, we have If , we recognize Equation 5 as the equation of an ellipse.

The definition of vector addition is illustrated in Figure 3. You can see why this defi- nition is sometimes called the Triangle Law . In Figure 4 we start with the same vectors and as in Figure 3 and draw another copy of with the same initial point as . Completing the parallelogram, we see that . This also gives another way to construct the sum: If we place and so they start at the same point, then lies along the diagonal of the parallelo- gram with and as sides. (This is called the Parallelogram Law .) EXAMPLE 1 Draw the sum of the vectors shown in Figure 5. SOLUTION First we translate and place its tail at the tip of , being careful to draw a copy of that has the same length and direction. Then we draw the vector [see Figure 6(a)] starting at the initial point of and ending at the terminal point of the copy of . Alternatively, we could place so it starts where starts and construct by the Parallelogram Law as in Figure 6(b). ■ It is possible to multiply a vector by a real number . (In this context we call the real number a scalar to distinguish it from a vector.) For instance, we want to be the same vector as , which has the same direction as but is twice as long.

In Section 10.9 we will see how they describe the velocity and acceleration of objects moving in space. Here we look at forces. A force is represented by a vector because it has both a magnitude (measured in pounds or newtons) and a direction. If several forces are acting on an object, the resul- tant force experienced by the object is the vector sum of these forces. EXAMPLE 7 A 100-lb weight hangs from two wires as shown in Figure 19. Find the tensions (forces) and in both wires and their magnitudes. SOLUTION We first express and in terms of their horizontal and vertical com- ponents. From Figure 20 we see that The resultant of the tensions counterbalances the weight and so we must have Thus Equating components, we get Solving the first of these equations for and substituting into the second, we get \u0006 T 1 \u0006 sin 50 \u0003 \u0006 T 1 \u0006 cos 50 cos 32 sin 32 \u0002 100 \u0006 T 2 \u0006 \u0006 T 1 \u0006 sin 50 \u0003 \u0006 T 2 \u0006 sin 32 \u0002 100 \u0002 \u0006 T 1 \u0006 cos 50 \u0003 \u0006 T 2 \u0006 cos 32 \u0002 0 ( \u0002 \u0006 T 1 \u0006 cos 50 \u0003 \u0006 T 2 \u0006 cos 32 ) i \u0003 ( \u0006 T"

(See Figure 3.) The area of the base parallelogram is . If is the angle between and , then the height of the parallelepiped is . (We must use instead of in case .) Therefore, the volume of the parallelepiped is Thus we have proved the following formula.

      "text": "TORQUE The idea of a cross product occurs often in physics. In particular, we consider a force acting on a rigid body at a point given by a position vector . (For instance, if we tighten a bolt by applying a force to a wrench as in Figure 4, we produce a turning effect.) The torque (relative to the origin) is defined to be the cross product of the position and force vectors and measures the tendency of the body to rotate about the origin. The direction of the torque vector indicates the axis of rotation. According to Theorem 6, the magnitude of the torque vector is where is the angle between the position and force vectors. Observe that the only component of that can cause a rotation is the one perpendicular to , that is, . The magnitude of the torque is equal to the area of the parallelogram deter- mined by and . EXAMPLE 6 A bolt is tightened by applying a 40-N force to a 0.25-m wrench as shown in Figure 5. Find the magnitude of the torque about the center of the bolt.

Here we investigate two other types of surfaces—cylinders and quadric surfaces. In order to sketch the graph of a surface, it is useful to determine the curves of intersection of the surface with planes parallel to the coordinate planes. These curves are called traces (or cross-sections) of the surface. 10.6"

The arrows in Figure 6 indicate the direction in which C is traced as the parameter t increases. ■ USING COMPUTERS TO DRAW SPACE CURVES Space curves are inherently more difficult to draw by hand than plane curves; for an accurate representation we need to use technology. For instance, Figure 7 shows a computer-generated graph of the curve with parametric equations It’s called a toroidal spiral because it lies on a torus. Another interesting curve, the trefoil knot , with equations is graphed in Figure 8. It wouldn’t be easy to plot either of these curves by hand. Even when a computer is used to draw a space curve, optical illusions make it dif- ficult to get a good impression of what the curve really looks like. (This is especially true in Figure 8.) The next example shows how to cope with this problem. EXAMPLE 7 Use a computer to draw the curve with vector equation This curve is called a twisted cubic .

      "text": "dimensional computer graphing programs allow the user to enclose a curve or sur- face in a box instead of displaying the coordinate axes. When we look at the same curve in a box in Figure 9(b), we have a much clearer picture of the curve. We can see that it climbs from a lower corner of the box to the upper corner nearest us, and it twists as it climbs. We get an even better idea of the curve when we view it from different vantage points. Part (c) shows the result of rotating the box to give another viewpoint. ■ DERIVATIVES The derivative of a vector function is defined in much the same way as for real- valued functions: if this limit exists. The geometric significance of this definition is shown in Figure 10. If the points and have position vectors and , then PQ l represents the vector , which can therefore be regarded as a secant vector. If , the scalar multiple has the same direction as . As , it appears that this vector approaches a vector that lies on the tangent line. For this reason, the vector is called the tangent vector to the curve defined by at the point , provided that exists and . The tangent line to at is defined to be the line through parallel to the tangent vector .

Geometrically, this result says that if a curve lies on a sphere with center the origin, then the tangent vector is always perpendicular to the position vector . ■ INTEGRALS The definite integral of a continuous vector function can be defined in much the same way as for real-valued functions except that the integral is a vector. But then we can express the integral of in terms of the integrals of its component functions , , and as follows. (We use the notation of Chapter 5.) and so This means that we can evaluate an integral of a vector function by integrating each component function.

We can see directly from the definition of curvature that the curvature of a straight line is always 0 because the tangent vector is constant. Although Formula 9 can be used in all cases to compute the curvature, the formula given by the following theorem is often more convenient to apply.

Suppose a particle moves through space so that its position vector at time is . Notice from Figure 1 that, for small values of , the vector approximates the direction of the particle moving along the curve . Its magnitude measures the size of the displacement vector per unit time. The vector (1) gives the average velocity over a time interval of length and its limit is the velocity vector at time : Thus the velocity vector is also the tangent vector and points in the direction of the tan- gent line. The speed of the particle at time is the magnitude of the velocity vector, that is, . This is appropriate because, from (2) and from Equation 10.8.7, we have As in the case of one-dimensional motion, the acceleration of the particle is defined as the derivative of the velocity: a \u0002 t \u0003 \u0002 v \u0012 \u0002 t \u0003 \u0002 r \u0014 \u0002 t \u0003 \u0006 v \u0002 t \u0003 \u0006 \u0002 \u0006 r \u0012 \u0002 t \u0003 \u0006 \u0002 ds dt \u0002 rate of change of distance with respect to time \u0006 v \u0002 t \u0003 \u0006 t v \u0002 t \u0003 \u0002 lim h l 0 r \u0002 t \u0003 h \u0003 \u0002 r \u0002 t \u0003 h \u0002 r \u0012 \u0002 t \u0003 2 t v \u0002 t \u0003 h r \u0002 t \u0003 r \u0002 t \u0003 h \u0003 \u0002 r \u0002 t \u0003 h 1 h r \u0002 t \u0003 t 10.9 578 ■ CHAPTER 10 VECTORS AND THE GEOMETRY OF SPACE FIGURE 1 r (t+h)- r (t) h O C P Q r ª(t) r (t+h) r (t) x z y"

This makes sense if we think of a passenger in a car—a sharp turn in a road means a large value of the curvature , so the component of the acceleration perpendicular to the motion is large and the passenger is thrown against a car door. High speed around the turn has the same effect; in fact, if you double your speed, is increased by a factor of 4.

      "text": "KEPLER’S LAWS OF PLANETARY MOTION We now describe one of the great accomplishments of calculus by showing how the material of this chapter can be used to prove Kepler’s laws of planetary motion. After 20 years of studying the astronomical observations of the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, the German mathematician and astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) for- mulated the following three laws. KEPLER’S LAWS 1. A planet revolves around the Sun in an elliptical orbit with the Sun at one focus. 2. The line joining the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times. 3. The square of the period of revolution of a planet is proportional to the cube of the length of the major axis of its orbit. In his book Principia Mathematica of 1687, Sir Isaac Newton was able to show that these three laws are consequences of two of his own laws, the Second Law of Motion and the Law of Universal Gravitation. In what follows we prove Kepler’s First Law. The remaining laws are proved as a Web Project (with hints). Since the gravitational force of the Sun on a planet is so much larger than the forces exerted by other celestial bodies, we can safely ignore all bodies in the universe except the Sun and one planet revolving about it. We use a coordinate system with the Sun at the origin and we let be the position vector of the planet.

The volume of a circular cylinder depends on its radius and its height . In fact, we know that . We say that is a function of and , and we write . DEFINITION A function of two variables is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair of real numbers in a set a unique real number denoted by . The set is the domain of and its range is the set of values that takes on, that is, . We often write to make explicit the value taken on by at the general point . The variables and are independent variables and is the dependent variable . [Compare this with the notation for functions of a single variable.] A function of two variables is just a function whose domain is a subset of and whose range is a subset of . One way of visualizing such a function is by means of an arrow diagram (see Figure 1), where the domain is represented as a subset of the -plane. If a function is given by a formula and no domain is specified, then the domain of is understood to be the set of all pairs for which the given expression is a well-defined real number. \u0002 x , y \u0003 f f FIGURE 1 y x 0 0 z D f f(a, b) f(x, y) (x, y) (a, b) xy D \u0002 \u0002 2 y \u0002 f \u0002 x \u0003 z y x \u0002 x , y \u0003 f z \u0002 f \u0002 x , y \u0003 f \u0002 x , y \u0003 \u0006 \u0002 x , y \u0003 \u0003 D f f D f \u0002"

SOLUTION The graph of has the equation , or , which represents a plane. To graph the plane we first find the intercepts. Putting in the equation, we get as the -intercept. Similarly, the -intercept is 3 and the -intercept is 6.

LEVEL CURVES So far we have two methods for visualizing functions: arrow diagrams and graphs.

A level curve is the set of all points in the domain of at which takes on a given value . In other words, it shows where the graph of has height .

The surface is steep where the level curves are close together. It is somewhat flatter where they are farther apart. One common example of level curves occurs in topographic maps of mountainous regions, such as the map in Figure 11. The level curves are curves of constant eleva- tion above sea level. If you walk along one of these contour lines you neither ascend nor descend. Another common example is the temperature function introduced in the opening paragraph of this section. Here the level curves are called isothermals and join locations with the same temperature. Figure 12 shows a weather map of the world indicating the average January temperatures. The isothermals are the curves that sep- arate the shaded bands.

Then , where is the slope, and So Thus has the same limiting value along every nonvertical line through the origin. But that does not show that the given limit is 0, for if we now let along the parabola , we have so Since different paths lead to different limiting values, the given limit does not exist. ■ Now let’s look at limits that do exist. Just as for functions of one variable, the cal- culation of limits for functions of two variables can be greatly simplified by the use of properties of limits. The Limit Laws listed in Section 1.4 can be extended to functions of two variables: The limit of a sum is the sum of the limits, the limit of a product is the product of the limits, and so on. In particular, the following equations are true. The Squeeze Theorem also holds. EXAMPLE 4 Find if it exists.

We want to find such that if that is, if But since , so and therefore Thus if we choose and let , then Hence, by Definition 1, ■ CONTINUITY Recall that evaluating limits of continuous functions of a single variable is easy. It can be accomplished by direct substitution because the defining property of a continuous function is . Continuous functions of two variables are also defined by the direct substitution property. DEFINITION A function of two variables is called continuous at if We say is continuous on if is continuous at every point in . The intuitive meaning of continuity is that if the point changes by a small amount, then the value of changes by a small amount. This means that a sur- face that is the graph of a continuous function has no hole or break. Using the properties of limits, you can see that sums, differences, products, and quotients of continuous functions are continuous on their domains. Let’s use this fact to give examples of continuous functions. A polynomial function of two variables (or polynomial, for short) is a sum of terms of the form , where is a constant and and are nonnegative integers. A rational function is a ratio of polynomials.

Then the corresponding increment of is Thus the increment represents the change in the value of when changes from to . By analogy with (5) we define the differentiability of a function of two variables as follows. DEFINITION If , then is differentiable at if can be expressed in the form where and as . Definition 7 says that a differentiable function is one for which the linear approxi- mation (4) is a good approximation when is near .

Notice that Theorem 3 has one term for each intermediate variable and each of these terms resembles the one-dimensional Chain Rule in Equation 1. To remember the Chain Rule it’s helpful to draw the tree diagram in Figure 2. We draw branches from the dependent variable to the intermediate variables and to indicate that is a function of and . Then we draw branches from and to the independent variables and . On each branch we write the corresponding partial derivative. To find we find the product of the partial derivatives along each path from to and then add these products: Similarly, we find by using the paths from to .

So it seems reasonable that if we move in the perpendicular direction, we get the maximum increase. In like manner we consider a function of two variables and a point in its domain. Again the gradient vector gives the direction of fastest increase of . Also, by considerations similar to our discussion of tangent planes, it can be shown that is perpendicular to the level curve that passes through . Again this is intuitively plausible because the values of remain constant as we move along the curve. (See Figure 9.) If we consider a topographical map of a hill and let represent the height above sea level at a point with coordinates , then a curve of steepest ascent can be drawn as in Figure 10 by making it perpendicular to all of the contour lines.

[A boundary point of D is a point such that every disk with center con- tains points in D and also points not in D .] For instance, the disk which consists of all points on and inside the circle , is a closed set because it contains all of its boundary points (which are the points on the circle ). But if even one point on the boundary curve were omitted, the set would not be closed. (See Figure 7.) A bounded set in is one that is contained within some disk. In other words, it is finite in extent. Then, in terms of closed and bounded sets, we can state the follow- ing counterpart of the Extreme Value Theorem in two dimensions.

For functions of one variable it is impossible for a con- tinuous function to have two local maxima and no local minimum. But for functions of two variables such functions exist. Show that the function has only two critical points, but has local maxima at both of them. Then use a computer to produce a graph with a carefully chosen domain and viewpoint to see how this is possible. ; 30. If a function of one variable is continuous on an interval and has only one critical number, then a local maximum has to be an absolute maximum. But this is not true for functions of two variables.

In this section we present Lagrange’s method for maximizing or min- imizing a general function subject to a constraint (or side condition) of the form . It’s easier to explain the geometric basis of Lagrange’s method for functions of two variables. So we start by trying to find the extreme values of subject to a con- straint of the form . In other words, we seek the extreme values of when the point is restricted to lie on the level curve . Figure 1 shows this curve together with several level curves of .

To maximize subject to is to find the largest value of such that the level curve intersects . It appears from Figure 1 that this happens when these curves just touch each other, that is, when they have a common tangent line. (Otherwise, the value of c could be increased fur- ther.) This means that the normal lines at the point where they touch are iden- tical. So the gradient vectors are parallel; that is, for some scalar . This kind of argument also applies to the problem of finding the extreme values of subject to the constraint . Thus the point is restricted to lie on the level surface with equation . Instead of the level curves in Figure 1, we consider the level surfaces and argue that if the maximum value of is , then the level surface is tangent to the level surface and so the corresponding gradient vectors are parallel. t \u0002 x , y , z \u0003 \u0002 k f \u0002 x , y , z \u0003 \u0002 c f \u0002 x 0 , y 0 , z 0 \u0003 \u0002 c f f \u0002 x , y , z \u0003 \u0002 c t \u0002 x , y , z \u0003 \u0002 k S \u0002 x , y , z \u0003 t \u0002 x , y , z \u0003 \u0002 k f \u0002 x , y , z \u0003 \u001b ( f \u0002 x 0 , y 0 \u0003 \u0002 \u001b ( t \u0002 x 0 , y 0 \u0003 \u0002 x 0 , y 0 \u0003 t \u0002 x , y \u0003 \u0002 k f \u0002 x , y \u0003 \u0002 c c t \u0002 x , y \u0003 \u0002 k f \u0002 x , y \u0003 11 10 9 8 c \u0002 7 f \u0002 x , y \u0003 \u0002 c , f t \u0002 x , y \u0003 \u0002 k \u0002 x , y \u0003 f \u0002 x , y \u0003 t \u0002 x , y \u0003 \u0002 k f \u0002 x , y \u0003 t \u0002 x , y , z \u0003 \u0002 k f \u0002 x , y , z \u0003 2 2 x z \u0003 2 y z \u0003 xy \u0002 12 V \u0002 xy z 11.8 f(x, y)=11 f(x, y)=10 f(x, y)=9 f("

We will see that polar coordinates are useful in computing double integrals over some types of regions. In a similar way, we will introduce two new coordinate systems in three-dimensional space––cylindrical coordinates and spherical coordinates––that greatly simplify the computation of triple integrals over certain commonly occurring solid regions. 12 663 0 y a b x x i_ ¡ x i x i * FIGURE 1 FIGURE 2 0 R z=f(x, y) c d a b x z y"

So if we denote by , the largest of the lengths of all the subintervals, we would expect that We use the expression in Equation 4 to define the volume of the solid that lies under the graph of and above the rectangle . (It can be shown that this definition is con- sistent with our formula for volume in Section 7.2.) Limits of the type that appear in Equation 4 occur frequently, not just in finding volumes but in a variety of other situations as well—as we will see in Section 12.4 – even when is not a positive function. So we make the following definition. DEFINITION The double integral of over the rectangle is if this limit exists. The precise meaning of the limit in Definition 5 is that for every number there is a corresponding number such that for all partitions of whose subinterval lengths are less than , and for any choice of sample points in A function is called integrable if the limit in Definition 5 exists.

But for double integrals, we want to be able to integrate a function not just over rectangles but also over regions of more general shape, such as the one illustrated in Figure 1. We suppose that is a bounded region, which means that can be enclosed in a rect- angular region as in Figure 2. Then we define a new function with domain by If the double integral of F exists over R , then we define the double integral of over D by Definition 2 makes sense because R is a rectangle and so has been previously defined in Section 12.1.

Often it is helpful to draw a vertical arrow as in Figure 8. Then the limits of integration for the inner integral can be read from the diagram as follows: The arrow starts at the lower boundary , which gives the lower limit in the integral, and the arrow ends at the upper boundary , which gives the upper limit of inte- gration. For a type II region the arrow is drawn horizontally from the left boundary to the right boundary.

Figure 13 shows the tetrahedron bounded by the coordinate planes , , the vertical plane , and the plane . Since the plane intersects the -plane (whose equation is ) in the line , we see that lies above the triangular region in the -plane bounded by the lines , , and . (See Figure 14.)

      "text": "APPLICATIONS OF DOUBLE INTEGRALS We have already seen one application of double integrals: computing volumes. Another geometric application is finding areas of surfaces and this will be done in the next chapter. In this section we explore physical applications such as computing mass, electric charge, center of mass, and moment of inertia. DENSITY AND MASS In Chapter 7 we were able to use single integrals to compute moments and the center of mass of a thin plate or lamina with constant density. But now, equipped with the double integral, we can consider a lamina with variable density. Suppose the lamina occupies a region of the -plane and its density (in units of mass per unit area) at a point in is given by , where is a continuous function on . This means that where and are the mass and area of a small rectangle that contains and the limit is taken as the dimensions of the rectangle approach 0. (See Figure 1.) To find the total mass of the lamina we divide a rectangle containing into subrectangles (as in Figure 2) and consider to be 0 outside . If we choose a point in , then the mass of the part of the lamina that occupies is approximately , where is the area of . If we add all such masses, we get an approximation to the total mass: If we now take finer partitions by using smaller subrectangles, we obtain the total mass of the lamina as the limiting value of the approximations: Physicists also consider other types of density that can be treated in the same man- ner.

Suppose the lamina occupies a region and has density function . Recall from Chapter 7 that we defined the moment of a particle about an axis as the product of its mass and its directed distance from the axis. We divide into small rectangles as in Figure 2. Then the mass of is approximately , so we can approximate the moment of with respect to the -axis by If we now add these quantities and take the limit as the subrectangles become smaller, we obtain the moment of the entire lamina about the x -axis : Similarly, the moment about the y -axis is As before, we define the center of mass so that and . The physical significance is that the lamina behaves as if its entire mass is concentrated at its center of mass. Thus the lamina balances horizontally when supported at its center of mass (see Figure 4).

We divide into small rectangles, approximate the moment of inertia of each subrectangle about the -axis, and take the limit of the sum as the subrectangles become smaller.

Thus ■ In Example 4 notice that the mass of the disk is so the moment of inertia of the disk about the origin (like a wheel about its axle) can be written as Thus if we increase the mass or the radius of the disk, we thereby increase the mo- ment of inertia. In general, the moment of inertia plays much the same role in rota- tional motion that mass plays in linear motion. The moment of inertia of a wheel is what makes it difficult to start or stop the rotation of the wheel, just as the mass of a car is what makes it difficult to start or stop the motion of the car. The radius of gyration of a lamina about an axis is the number such that where is the mass of the lamina and is the moment of inertia about the given axis. Equation 9 says that if the mass of the lamina were concentrated at a distance from the axis, then the moment of inertia of this “point mass” would be the same as the moment of inertia of the lamina. In particular, the radius of gyration with respect to the -axis and the radius of gyration with respect to the -axis are given by the equations Thus is the point at which the mass of the lamina can be concentrated without changing the moments of inertia with respect to the coordinate axes.

By analogy with the definition of a double integral (12.1.5), we define the triple integral as the limit of the triple Riemann sums in (2) as the sub-boxes shrink. DEFINITION The triple integral of over the box is if this limit exists. Again, the triple integral always exists if is continuous. We can choose the sample point to be any point in the sub-box, but if we choose it to be the point , and if we choose sub-boxes with the same dimensions. so that , we get a simpler- looking expression for the triple integral: Just as for double integrals, the practical method for evaluating triple integrals is to express them as iterated integrals as follows. FUBINI’S THEOREM FOR TRIPLE INTEGRALS If is continuous on the rectangular box , then The iterated integral on the right side of Fubini’s Theorem means that we integrate first with respect to (keeping and fixed), then we integrate with respect to (keep- ing fixed), and finally we integrate with respect to .

Remember that the limits of integration in the inner integral contain at most two variables, the limits of integration in the middle integral contain at most one variable, and the limits of integration in the outer inte- gral must be constants."

      "text": "TRIPLE INTEGRALS IN CYLINDRICAL COORDINATES In plane geometry the polar coordinate system is used to give a convenient description of certain curves and regions. (See Section 9.3.) Figure 1 enables us to recall the con- nection between polar and Cartesian coordinates. If the point has Cartesian coordi- nates and polar coordinates , then, from the figure, In three dimensions there is a coordinate system, called cylindrical coordinates , that is similar to polar coordinates and gives convenient descriptions of some commonly occurring surfaces and solids. As we will see, some triple integrals are much easier to evaluate in cylindrical coordinates. CYLINDRICAL COORDINATES In the cylindrical coordinate system , a point in three-dimensional space is repre- sented by the ordered triple , where and are polar coordinates of the pro- jection of onto the -plane and is the directed distance from the -plane to (see Figure 2).

      "text": "(b) From Equations 2 we have so Therefore, one set of cylindrical coordinates is . Another is . As with polar coordinates, there are infinitely many choices. ■ Cylindrical coordinates are useful in problems that involve symmetry about an axis, and the -axis is chosen to coincide with this axis of symmetry. For instance, the axis of the circular cylinder with Cartesian equation is the -axis. In cylindrical coordinates this cylinder has the very simple equation . (See Figure 4.) This is the reason for the name “cylindrical” coordinates. EXAMPLE 2 Describe the surface whose equation in cylindrical coordinates is . SOLUTION The equation says that the -value, or height, of each point on the sur- face is the same as r , the distance from the point to the -axis. Because doesn’t appear, it can vary. So any horizontal trace in the plane is a circle of radius k . These traces suggest that the surface is a cone. This prediction can be con- firmed by converting the equation into rectangular coordinates. From the first equa- tion in (2) we have We recognize the equation (by comparison with Table 1 in Section 10.6) as being a circular cone whose axis is the -axis (see Figure 5). ■ EVALUATING TRIPLE INTEGRALS WITH CYLINDRICAL COORDINATES Suppose that is a type 1 region whose projection on the -plane is conveniently described in polar coordinates (see Figure 6).

      "text": "EVALUATING TRIPLE INTEGRALS WITH SPHERICAL COORDINATES In the spherical coordinate system the counterpart of a rectangular box is a spherical wedge where and . Although we defined triple integrals by dividing solids into small boxes, it can be shown that dividing a solid into small spherical wedges always gives the same result. So we divide into smaller spherical wedges by means of spheres , half-planes , and half-cones . Figure 7 shows that is approximately a rectangular box with dimensions , (arc of a cir- cle with radius angle ), and (arc of a circle with radius angle ). So an approximation to the volume of is given by In fact, it can be shown, with the aid of the Mean Value Theorem (Exercise 41), that the volume of is given exactly by where is some point in . Let be the rectangular coordi- nates of this point. Then But this sum is a Riemann sum for the function Consequently, we have arrived at the following formula for triple integration in spherical coordinates . where is a spherical wedge given by Formula 3 says that we convert a triple integral from rectangular coordinates to spherical coordinates by writing using the appropriate limits of integration, and replacing by .

      "text": "VECTOR FIELDS The vectors in Figure 1(a) are air velocity vectors that indicate the wind speed and direction at points 10 m above the surface elevation in the San Francisco Bay area at noon on June 11, 2002. We see at a glance from the largest arrows that the greatest wind speeds at that time occurred as the winds entered the bay across the Golden Gate Bridge. Associated with every point in the air we can imagine a wind velocity vector. This is an example of a velocity vector field. Another example of a velocity vector field is illustrated in Figure 1(b). Another type of vector field, called a force field, associates a force vector with each point in a region. An example is the gravitational force field that we will look at in Example 4. In general, a vector field is a function whose domain is a set of points in (or ) and whose range is a set of vectors in (or ). DEFINITION Let be a set in (a plane region). A vector field on is a function that assigns to each point in a two-dimensional vector . The best way to picture a vector field is to draw the arrow representing the vector starting at the point . Of course, it’s impossible to do this for all points , but we can gain a reasonable impression of by doing it for a few representa- tive points in as in Figure 2.

(These are functions that assign vectors to points in space.) In particular we define line integrals (which can be used to find the work done by a force field in moving an object along a curve).Then we define surface integrals (which can be used to find the rate of fluid flow across a surface).The connections between these new types of integrals and the single, double, and triple integrals that we have already met are given by the higher-dimensional versions of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: Green’s Theorem, Stokes’ Theorem, and the Divergence Theorem. 13 725 FIGURE 1 Velocity vector fields FIGURE 2 Vector field on R @ 0 (x, y) F (x, y) x y"

They give a better impression of the vector field than is possible by hand because the computer can plot a large number of representative vectors. Figure 5 shows a computer plot of the vector field in Example 1; Figures 6 and 7 show two other vector fields. Notice that the computer scales the lengths of the vectors so they are not too long and yet are proportional to their true lengths. EXAMPLE 2 Sketch the vector field on given by . SOLUTION The sketch is shown in Figure 8. Notice that all vectors are vertical and point upward above the -plane or downward below it. The magnitude increases with the distance from the -plane. ■ We were able to draw the vector field in Example 2 by hand because of its partic- ularly simple formula. Most three-dimensional vector fields, however, are virtually impossible to sketch by hand and so we need to resort to a computer. Examples are shown in Figures 9, 10, and 11. Notice that the vector fields in Figures 9 and 10 have similar formulas, but all the vectors in Figure 10 point in the general direction of the negative y -axis because their y -components are all \u0002 2.

Such inte- grals are called line integrals, although “curve integrals” would be better terminology. They were invented in the early 19th century to solve problems involving fluid flow, forces, electricity, and magnetism. We start with a plane curve given by the parametric equations or, equivalently, by the vector equation , and we assume that is a smooth curve. [This means that is continuous and . See Section 10.7.] If we divide the parameter interval into n subintervals and we let and , then the corresponding points divide into sub- arcs with lengths (See Figure 1.) We choose any point in the th subarc. (This corresponds to a point in .) Now if is any function of two variables whose domain includes the curve , we evaluate at the point , multiply by the length of the subarc, and form the sum which is similar to a Riemann sum. Then we take the limit of these sums and make the following definition by analogy with a single integral.

Thus, in general, the value of a line integral depends not just on the endpoints of the curve but also on the path. (But see Sec- tion 13.3 for conditions under which the integral is independent of the path.) Notice also that the answers in Example 4 depend on the direction, or orientation, of the curve.

THEOREM is independent of path in if and only if for every closed path in . Since we know that the line integral of any conservative vector field is inde- pendent of path, it follows that for any closed path. The physical inter- pretation is that the work done by a conservative force field (such as the gravitational or electric field in Section 13.1) as it moves an object around a closed path is 0. The following theorem says that the only vector fields that are independent of path are conservative. It is stated and proved for plane curves, but there is a similar version for space curves. We assume that is open , which means that for every point in there is a disk with center that lies entirely in . (So doesn’t contain any of its boundary points.) In addition, we assume that is connected . This means that any two points in can be joined by a path that lies in .

To explain this, we first need the concept of a simple curve , which is a curve that doesn’t intersect itself anywhere between its endpoints. [See Figure 6; for a simple closed curve, but when .] In Theorem 4 we needed an open connected region. For the next theorem we need a stronger condition. A simply-connected region in the plane is a connected region such that every simple closed curve in encloses only points that are in . Notice from Figure 7 that, intuitively speaking, a simply-connected region contains no hole and can’t consist of two separate pieces. In terms of simply-connected regions we can now state a partial converse to Theo- rem 5 that gives a convenient method for verifying that a vector field on is con- servative. The proof will be sketched in the next section as a consequence of Green’s Theorem. THEOREM Let be a vector field on an open simply-con- nected region .

Now let’s further assume that is a conservative force field; that is, we can write . In physics, the potential energy of an object at the point is defined as , so we have . Then by Theorem 2 we have Comparing this equation with Equation 16, we see that which says that if an object moves from one point to another point under the influ- ence of a conservative force field, then the sum of its potential energy and its kinetic energy remains constant.

Let’s call such regions simple regions . PROOF OF GREEN’S THEOREM FOR THE CASE IN WHICH IS A SIMPLE REGION Notice that Green’s Theorem will be proved if we can show that and We prove Equation 2 by expressing as a type I region: where and are continuous functions. This enables us to compute the double integral on the right side of Equation 2 as follows: where the last step follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Now we compute the left side of Equation 2 by breaking up as the union of the four curves , , , and shown in Figure 3. On we take as the parameter and write the parametric equations as , , .

He worked full-time in his father’s bakery from the age of nine and taught himself mathematics from library books. In 1828 he published privately An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism , but only 100 copies were printed and most of those went to his friends. This pamphlet contained a theorem that is equiva- lent to what we know as Green’s Theorem, but it didn’t become widely known at that time. Finally, at age 40, Green entered Cambridge University as an undergraduate but died four years after graduation. In 1846 William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) located a copy of Green’s essay, realized its significance, and had it reprinted. Green was the first person to try to formulate a mathematical theory of electr"

Observe that the boundary of the region in Fig- ure 8 consists of two simple closed curves and .

Thus the positive direction is counterclockwise for the outer curve but clockwise for the inner curve .

If is a function of three variables, we have and this expression occurs so often that we abbreviate it as . The operator is called the Laplace operator because of its relation to Laplace’s equation We can also apply the Laplace operator to a vector field in terms of its components: VECTOR FORMS OF GREEN’S THEOREM The curl and divergence operators allow us to rewrite Green’s Theorem in versions that will be useful in our later work. We suppose that the plane region , its boundary curve , and the functions and satisfy the hypotheses of Green’s Theorem. Then we consider the vector field .

SOLUTION The sphere has a simple representation in spherical coordinates, so let’s choose the angles and in spherical coordinates as the parameters (see Section 12.7). Then, putting in the equations for conversion from spherical to rectangular coordinates (Equations 12.7.1), we obtain as the parametric equations of the sphere.

PARAMETRIC SURFACES Suppose that a surface has a vector equation We first assume that the parameter domain is a rectangle and we divide it into sub- rectangles with dimensions and . Then the surface is divided into corre- sponding patches as in Figure 1. We evaluate at a point in each patch, multiply by the area of the patch, and form the Riemann sum Then we take the limit as the number of patches increases (and their dimensions \u0014 m i \u0002 1 \u0014 n j \u0002 1 f \u0002 P ij * \u0003 \u0013 S ij \u0013 Sij P ij * f S ij S \u0013 v j \u0013 ui R ij D \u0002 u , v \u0003 \u0003 D r \u0002 u , v \u0003 \u0002 x \u0002 u , v \u0003 i \u0003 y \u0002 u , v \u0003 j \u0003 z \u0002 u , v \u0003 k S S S f \u0002 x , y , z \u0003 \u0002 1 S f S f 13.7 FIGURE 1 0 √ u R ij Îu 0 z y x P * ij S S ij D r i Î√ j"

So, taking in Formula 4 and converting to polar coordinates, we have Therefore ■ ORIENTED SURFACES To define surface integrals of vector fields, we need to rule out nonorientable surfaces such as the Möbius strip shown in Figure 4. [It is named after the German geometer August Möbius (1790–1868).] You can construct one for yourself by taking a long rectangular strip of paper, giving it a half-twist, and taping the short edges together as in Figure 5. If an ant were to crawl along the Möbius strip starting at a point , it would end up on the “other side” of the strip (that is, with its upper side pointing in the opposite direction). Then, if the ant continued to crawl in the same direction, it would end up back at the same point without ever having crossed an edge. (If you have constructed a Möbius strip, try drawing a pencil line down the middle.) Therefore, a Möbius strip really has only one side. You can graph the Möbius strip using the parametric equations in Exercise 28 in Section 13.6.

For instance, if is an electric field (see Example 5 in Section 13.1), then the surface integral is called the electric flux of through the surface . One of the important laws of electrostatics is Gauss’s Law , which says that the net charge enclosed by a closed sur- face is where is a constant (called the permittivity of free space) that depends on the units used. (In the SI system, C \b .) Therefore, if the vector field in Example 4 represents an electric field, we can conclude that the charge enclosed by is .

Figure 1 shows an oriented surface with unit normal vector . The orientation of induces the positive orientation of the boundary curve C shown in the figure. This means that if you walk in the positive direction around with your head point- ing in the direction of , then the surface will always be on your left.

Stokes was a professor at Cam- bridge University (in fact he held the same position as Newton, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics) and was especially noted for his studies of fluid flow and light. What we call Stokes’ Theorem was actually discovered by the Scottish physicist Sir William Thomson (1824–1907, known as Lord Kelvin). Stokes learned of this theorem in a letter from Thomson in 1850 and asked students to prove it on an examination at Cambridge University in 1854. We don’t know if any of those students was able to do so."

This means that if we have another oriented surface with the same boundary curve , then we get exactly the same value for the surface integral! In general, if and are oriented surfaces with the same oriented boundary curve and both satisfy the hypotheses of Stokes’ Theorem, then This fact is useful when it is difficult to integrate over one surface but easy to integrate over the other. We now use Stokes’ Theorem to throw some light on the meaning of the curl vec- tor. Suppose that is an oriented closed curve and represents the velocity field in fluid flow. Consider the line integral and recall that is the component of in the direction of the unit tangent vector . This means that the closer the direction of is to the direction of , the larger the value of . Thus is a measure of the tendency of the fluid to move around and is called the circulation of around .

If we were seeking to extend this theorem to vector fields on , we might make the guess that where is the boundary surface of the solid region . It turns out that Equation 1 is true, under appropriate hypotheses, and is called the Divergence Theorem. Notice its similarity to Green’s Theorem and Stokes’ Theorem in that it relates the integral of a derivative of a function ( in this case) over a region to the integral of the original function over the boundary of the region. At this stage you may wish to review the various types of regions over which we were able to evaluate triple integrals in Section 12.5. We state and prove the Diver- gence Theorem for regions that are simultaneously of types 1, 2, and 3 and we call such regions simple solid regions . (For instance, regions bounded by ellipsoids or rectangular boxes are simple solid regions.) The boundary of is a closed surface, and we use the convention, introduced in Section 13.7, that the positive orientation is out- ward; that is, the unit normal vector is directed outward from .

      "text": "tinuous. We approximate the flux over the boundary sphere as follows: This approximation becomes better as and suggests that Equation 8 says that is the net rate of outward flux per unit volume at . (This is the reason for the name divergence. ) If , the net flow is outward near and is called a source . If , the net flow is inward near and is called a sink . For the vector field in Figure 4, it appears that the vectors that end near are shorter than the vectors that start near Thus the net flow is outward near so and is a source. Near on the other hand, the incoming arrows are longer than the outgoing arrows. Here the net flow is inward, so and is a sink. We can use the formula for F to confirm this impression. Since , we have , which is positive when . So the points above the line are sources and those below are sinks. SUMMARY The main results of this chapter are all higher-dimensional versions of the Funda- mental Theorem of Calculus. To help you remember them, we collect them together here (without hypotheses) so that you can see more easily their essential similarity. Notice that in each case we have an integral of a “derivative” over a region on the left side, and the right side involves the values of the original function only on the bound- ary of the region.

The following table gives the correspondence between degree and radian measures of some common angles.

      "text": "PROOFS In this appendix we present proofs of several theorems that are stated in the main body of the text. The sections in which they occur are indicated in the margin. SECTION 1.4 We start by proving the Triangle Inequality, which is an important property of absolute value. THE TRIANGLE INEQUALITY If and are any real numbers, then Observe that if the numbers and are both positive or both negative, then the two sides in the Triangle Inequality are actually equal. But if and have opposite signs, the left side involves a subtraction and the right side does not. This makes the Triangle Inequality seem reasonable, but we can prove it as follows. PROOF Notice that is always true because equals either or . The corresponding statement for is Adding these inequalities, we get If we now use the fact that (with replaced by and by ), we obtain which is what we wanted to show. ■ LIMIT LAWS Suppose that is a constant and the limits and exist.

A NSWERING Q UESTIONS Enhanced WebAssign uses a variety of question types that you’re probably already familiar with using, such as multiple choice, true/false, free response, etc. Always be sure to pay close attention to any instructions within the question regarding how you are supposed to submit your answers. Numerical Questions There are a few key points to keep in mind when working on numeri- cal questions: ❍ Numbers can be entered in both scientific notation and numerical expressions, such as fractions. ❍ WebAssign uses the standard scientific notation “E” or “e” for “times 10 raised to the power.” (Note: both uppercase E and lowercase e are acceptable in WebAssign.) For example, 1e3 is the scientific notation for 1000. ❍ Numerical answers may not contain commas ( , ) or equal signs ( = ). ❍ Numerical answers may only contain: • Numbers • E or e for scientific notation • Mathematical operators +, -, *, / ❍ Numerical answers within 1% of the actual answer are count- ed as correct, unless your instructor chooses a different toler- ance. This is to account for rounding errors in calculations. In general, enter three significant figures for numerical answers. Answering Questions Enhanced WebAssign 17"

You will know that a unit is expected when there is no unit after the answer box . When you are expected to enter units and do not, you will get an error message telling you that units are required.

The arrows on the end of the line indicate that the line goes off to infinity on both ends. To draw a ray or a segment, first click the small arrow on the right side of the line button to open the selection of line-type tools. Choose ray or segment, and then place it by clicking twice within the drawing area. For rays, the first point is the endpoint of the ray. The arrow on the other end of the ray indi- cates that it goes off to infinity on that end. Circles, points, and parabolas can be drawn in the same man- ner. Circles are drawn by placing a point at the center first, then a point on the radius of the circle. Parabolas are drawn by placing the vertex first, then a point on the parabola. Parabolas can be horizontal or vertical. Points are even easier—just click the point button and then click where you want the point to appear. Selecting Graph Objects To edit a graph object you have drawn, that object must be “selected” as the active object. (When you first draw an object, it is created in the selected state.)

Or click and drag one of the handles to move just that handle. On the keyboard, the arrow keys also move the selected object around by one unit. As you move the object or handle you’ll see that the Object Properties toolbar changes to remain up to date. You can also use the coordinate boxes in the Object Properties toolbar to edit the coordinates of the handles directly. Use this method to enter decimal or fractional coordinates. Using Fractions or Decimals as Coordinates To draw an object with handle coordinates that are fractions or decimals, you must use the Object Properties toolbar. Draw the desired object anywhere on the drawing area, then use the coordinate boxes in the Object Properties toolbar to change the endpoint(s) to the desired value. To enter a frac- tion just type “3/4” , for example. Note: The points and lines you draw must be exactly correct when you submit for grading. This means you should not round any of your values—if you want a point at 11/3, you should enter 11/3 in the coordinate box rather than 3.667. Also, mixed fractions are not acceptable entries.
